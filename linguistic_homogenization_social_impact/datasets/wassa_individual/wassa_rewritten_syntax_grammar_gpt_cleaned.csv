This truly disturbs me and highlights the blatant disregard that some individuals have for both animals and humans. It's beyond my comprehension.

Sadly, this incident is just one example of the disregard society has for the lives of animals and humans. It's infuriating to think that we have already lost 82 children and countless animals this year. I refuse to accept the inadequate explanations that are given on a daily basis.
