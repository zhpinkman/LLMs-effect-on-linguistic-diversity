The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.  No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day.

They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness. Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon.,-0.291433536,-0.363168457,0.018649935,0.9170520748639004,n,n,n,y,1,128,41.11,31.33,15.38,3.32,16.0,16.41,87.5,75.78,66.41,15.63,4.69,1.56,0.78,0.78,0.0,1.56,10.94,19.53,5.47,3.91,16.41,14.84,6.25,3.13,1.56,21.88,3.91,7.03,3.91,0.78,2.34,3.13,15.63,1.56,13.28,2.34,2.34,1.56,3.91,0.0,3.13,0.0,2.34,0.0,2.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.47,2.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,1.56,3.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.34,2.34,0.0,0.0,1.56,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.78,0.0,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.0,2.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.0,2.34,4.69,0.0,0.78,3.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.34,6.25,7.81,1.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.81,6.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.78,0,4.2734375,3.078125,6.515625,0.8359375,0.0703125,0.03125,0.03125,0.0703125,0.015625,0.140625,0.1171875,0.078125,0.0390625,0.09375

She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.,-0.291433536,-0.363168457,0.018649935,0.9170520748639004,n,n,n,y,1,130,21.6,91.46,2.13,6.78,11.82,18.46,93.08,80.0,64.62,20.77,15.38,2.31,1.54,0.0,9.23,1.54,5.38,17.69,8.46,1.54,10.77,8.46,7.69,7.69,1.54,20.0,4.62,3.85,4.62,3.08,0.77,0.77,12.31,2.31,10.0,2.31,0.77,1.54,0.77,0.77,2.31,0.0,8.46,3.08,4.62,5.38,0.77,3.85,0.0,0.0,3.08,0.0,19.23,3.08,1.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,15.38,0.0,0.77,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.54,0.0,0.0,1.54,0.0,0.0,3.85,2.31,0.77,0.0,1.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.77,0.77,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,4.62,6.92,0.0,3.08,4.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.08,9.23,3.08,2.31,0.77,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.46,8.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,3.976923076923077,3.1307692307692307,6.330769230769231,0.7769230769230769,0.046153846153846156,0.046153846153846156,0.03076923076923077,0.09230769230769231,0.05384615384615385,0.13846153846153847,0.12307692307692308,0.11538461538461539,0.023076923076923078,0.08461538461538462

It is absolutely sickening and i can't believe that someone could do that to another person or group of people. Something needs to be done about terrorism but what can we do without just creating more terrorists.,-2.255182847,-0.723067055,-0.380003461,0.7598387432244759,n,n,n,y,1,89,2.42,3.82,57.08,1.0,17.8,21.35,95.51,79.78,69.66,20.22,6.74,4.49,1.12,1.12,0.0,0.0,13.48,12.36,3.37,0.0,13.48,13.48,14.61,8.99,2.25,22.47,2.25,3.37,4.49,1.12,1.12,2.25,29.21,3.37,25.84,2.25,2.25,4.49,4.49,4.49,11.24,0.0,10.11,1.12,8.99,2.25,1.12,1.12,0.0,0.0,1.12,0.0,8.99,3.37,0.0,0.0,2.25,1.12,0.0,5.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.37,3.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.12,4.49,3.37,0.0,0.0,3.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.25,3.37,8.99,0.0,2.25,0.0,2.25,0.0,0.0,7.87,4.49,0.0,1.12,0.0,2.25,0.0,0,4.842696629213483,3.3258426966292136,7.157303370786517,1.0112359550561798,0.1797752808988764,0.011235955056179775,0.12359550561797752,0.14606741573033707,0.011235955056179775,0.3146067415730337,0.19101123595505617,0.1348314606741573,0.0449438202247191,0.0898876404494382

The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.

People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there. I think way more security now has to be implemented as this should have never even happened.

It has got to feel so on edge living in syria. You don't now who to trust not even your government. Innocent people and children are being killed so violently and senselessly. I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared. They can not travel back home anymore and that would just take a huge tole on me. Getting a warning text message that you are going to be bombed I dont now how I would react. You have 24 hours to leave everything you know and love and probably never see it that way again it is crazy.,0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,134,1.27,62.2,53.9,1.0,14.89,11.94,96.27,79.1,64.93,19.4,11.94,3.73,0.0,3.73,0.0,2.99,7.46,7.46,2.24,0.75,8.96,14.18,11.94,8.21,3.73,24.63,3.73,2.99,2.99,0.75,0.0,2.24,11.19,2.24,8.96,2.99,1.49,2.24,0.75,0.75,1.49,0.0,8.96,1.49,6.72,5.22,0.75,2.99,2.24,0.75,0.0,0.0,16.42,6.72,0.0,0.0,1.49,0.75,2.24,8.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,2.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,15.67,11.19,0.75,1.49,6.72,0.75,0.0,1.49,4.48,0.75,11.94,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.46,6.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0,3.656716417910448,2.8955223880597014,5.686567164179104,0.8656716417910447,0.11940298507462686,0.029850746268656716,0.08208955223880597,0.16417910447761194,0.03731343283582089,0.1791044776119403,0.12686567164179105,0.07462686567164178,0.05223880597014925,0.09701492537313433

No older people who worked there life so there familys can be better should be worried about war and losing the family. The doctors have even fled as there is no resources to help people anymore. Only once dialysis center left which will probably close soon for fear of people and lack of resources. Anyone with a chronic disease is just out of luck as medicine is few and aid cant even be reached to most of these people anymore.

I think alot of consumers have a lack of education when it comes to food, food safety, labeling, and disposal. If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.",0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,130,60.43,17.19,73.25,30.73,18.57,16.15,91.54,72.31,55.38,13.08,5.38,3.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.54,7.69,12.31,3.85,0.0,15.38,9.23,4.62,4.62,0.77,21.54,11.54,7.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.92,0.77,16.15,6.92,2.31,3.08,1.54,0.0,2.31,0.0,5.38,3.08,2.31,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.85,1.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.77,2.31,0.77,0.0,1.54,0.77,0.0,5.38,0.77,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.62,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.54,0.77,10.0,9.23,0.77,3.85,4.62,0.77,0.0,0.0,3.08,2.31,4.62,1.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.69,5.38,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,4.176923076923077,2.853846153846154,6.415384615384616,0.6153846153846154,0.06923076923076923,0.03076923076923077,0.06923076923076923,0.09230769230769231,0.06153846153846154,0.16923076923076924,0.16153846153846155,0.06153846153846154,0.007692307692307693,0.08461538461538462

We are one of the richest and advanced nations but yet our foster care system is low and bad. Compared to europes who keep the parental rights kids are left to wonder here. Children like this situation who have no structure get put in foster care and seen as bad ids when in reality they just need more love affection and direction.There should be more care done for these children as there life is just bad from the time there put in care. I feel so sorry these brothers had to grow up like this but happy he turned his life around got an education and is now in a career to help others and foster care children.,0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,132,40.61,84.23,50.45,98.14,26.4,13.64,89.39,74.24,55.3,11.36,6.82,0.76,1.52,0.76,1.52,0.76,4.55,12.88,4.55,0.76,14.39,7.58,9.85,9.09,0.76,21.97,6.82,3.03,6.06,4.55,0.0,1.52,9.85,0.76,9.09,2.27,0.0,2.27,1.52,0.76,3.03,0.0,11.36,9.09,2.27,4.55,2.27,2.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.7,7.58,6.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.61,1.52,0.0,0.0,2.27,0.76,0.76,0.0,0.0,2.27,0.0,0.0,1.52,0.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.27,0.0,1.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.76,11.36,15.15,0.0,2.27,11.36,0.76,0.0,0.76,2.27,3.79,5.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.55,4.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,3.862595419847328,3.312977099236641,6.251908396946565,0.9236641221374046,0.06870229007633588,0.0916030534351145,0.03816793893129771,0.06870229007633588,0.06870229007633588,0.08396946564885496,0.1297709923664122,0.06870229007633588,0.030534351145038167,0.0916030534351145

I can not imagine living in a place where the governemnt and law can do anything they please without consequences. Soldiers raping women burning down houses all with out real cause. Any aid workers and doctors are treated very poorly so theres not enough to go around how does this civilzation survive. Crazy how far behind and uncivilized some places still are in 2019.

It is horrible that either one of these men could have stopped this and helped but both were just cold people. How do you just go back to nromal life after muder I would fall to pieces. I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison. How could you kill and burn someone and for over something so minecule like getting hit on. Karma will get back at them and I hope in a grand way.

I had never thought of how places like zzos and themeparks are abundant with little minds that should not be subject to smoking. I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant.,0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,144,24.42,8.05,80.79,12.89,24.0,13.19,93.06,75.0,63.19,11.81,3.47,2.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.33,13.19,4.86,0.0,15.97,12.5,13.19,6.94,2.08,20.83,4.17,1.39,4.17,0.69,2.78,0.69,11.11,0.69,10.42,2.78,1.39,3.47,2.08,0.0,3.47,0.0,5.56,2.08,2.78,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.39,0.69,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.69,0.0,0.0,1.39,0.0,0.0,1.39,0.0,0.0,7.64,4.86,3.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.08,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.69,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.0,12.5,16.67,0.0,1.39,13.89,0.69,0.0,1.39,2.08,1.39,9.72,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.17,4.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,3.8402777777777777,3.0972222222222223,6.229166666666667,0.7083333333333334,0.125,0.06944444444444445,0.06944444444444445,0.13194444444444445,0.006944444444444444,0.14583333333333334,0.1388888888888889,0.09027777777777778,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664

They think they can just get away with it and there actions have no consequences. So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me.

These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

I think south africa needs a great peace keeping leader to step in and take the rains. It breaks my heart these people are subject to being afraid of such violence and brutality. The women that were raped and especially by there government is nonesense and cant believe in 2019 this is still happening. They need to create a more civilized society over there. Even aid workers who are just there to help were brutally raped that tells me these people have no consequences for actions and to consious of human suffering.

This father was just pure evil. He needed serious mental help and I can't believe no one saw this coming. There is always signs that people should take serious so it doesnt come to this. I would like to know the motive was it because he felt overwhelmed or because he wanted to get back at someone. The mother should have taken the threat seriosuly and I wonder if the rangers had found the car sooner if those kids would have been alive. They were probably so afraid in that car and it is horrible that was there last memories alive.,0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,123,2.6,30.99,21.76,6.3,15.38,12.2,95.12,79.67,60.16,17.89,6.5,2.44,0.0,0.81,2.44,0.81,11.38,14.63,4.07,0.0,6.5,14.63,8.13,8.13,4.07,26.83,8.13,0.81,3.25,2.44,0.0,0.81,25.2,3.25,21.95,6.5,4.07,7.32,4.88,0.0,4.07,0.81,6.5,2.44,4.07,3.25,1.63,1.63,1.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.38,2.44,0.81,0.0,0.81,0.81,0.0,8.13,1.63,0.0,0.81,3.25,1.63,0.0,0.0,1.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.44,1.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.81,2.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.81,8.13,8.13,0.0,1.63,6.5,0.81,0.0,0.81,2.44,10.57,4.07,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.32,6.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.0,0,3.894308943089431,3.154471544715447,6.243902439024391,0.8048780487804879,0.06504065040650407,0.056910569105691054,0.04065040650406504,0.06504065040650407,0.056910569105691054,0.11382113821138211,0.12195121951219512,0.07317073170731707,0.032520325203252036,0.04878048780487805

The general population does not now about there water unless it becomes a national crisis like flint. I am very cocerned because they said so many communities are effected what is this doing to the children who are growing up on this water.

It seems to be a very prevelant thing auto accidents and needs to be adressed with threat to the public. Also thinking about how traumatized the on scene responders but also the others who were on there and around it at the time I would feel so sad for a long time like survivors guilt.

I think older people should really be protected and watched carefully as this happens alot. Alot suffer from dimentia and have no idea what is going on and can get lost very easily. It makes me think if this was my parent or grandparent I would be heartbroken. She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her. I hope she is able to be reunited with her family quickly and they put safeguards in place so it never happends again.

This was also odd because he was older 70 years old,and hispanic I wonder if the tension and state of the US made him angered and want to carry out this act.",0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,129,30.58,20.19,26.92,1.0,25.8,13.18,92.25,77.52,57.36,11.63,6.98,2.33,0.0,0.0,1.55,2.33,4.65,7.75,4.65,0.78,12.4,10.85,6.98,10.85,0.0,21.71,6.2,2.33,3.88,0.78,1.55,2.33,24.03,1.55,22.48,4.65,2.33,6.2,5.43,1.55,6.2,0.0,7.75,0.78,6.98,0.78,0.0,0.78,0.0,0.78,0.0,0.0,10.85,5.43,0.78,0.0,0.78,1.55,1.55,4.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.55,2.33,1.55,0.78,0.0,1.55,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.78,0.0,4.65,3.88,0.0,0.0,3.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.78,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.33,8.53,7.75,0.0,0.78,4.65,0.0,0.0,2.33,3.88,6.2,3.88,0.0,0.78,0.0,0.78,0.0,0.0,4.65,3.88,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,3.9921875,2.9375,6.265625,0.6640625,0.1171875,0.0625,0.0625,0.1484375,0.0390625,0.1796875,0.1328125,0.0546875,0.0234375,0.0546875

This would be my worst fear being on a train or plain having no control or way out of such a big accident. They must have been so afraid once the train started rocking back and forth. I wonder what actually caused this horrible accident in the first place. They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it. The train should be shut down to avoid loss of life while it is investigated and corrected. It seems to be a totally avoidable way to lose a life and needs to have more security measures put into place.,0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,124,41.62,23.05,41.5,1.0,15.5,16.94,90.32,75.0,58.87,10.48,4.03,2.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.61,6.45,16.94,8.87,2.42,10.48,13.71,4.84,8.87,0.81,22.58,8.87,4.84,2.42,0.0,0.81,1.61,18.55,0.81,17.74,4.84,2.42,6.45,3.23,4.84,2.42,0.0,4.84,0.0,4.84,1.61,0.0,1.61,1.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.45,1.61,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,2.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.61,0.0,0.0,1.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.0,0.0,4.03,0.81,8.87,12.1,0.0,0.81,9.68,0.0,0.0,0.81,3.23,7.26,3.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.45,6.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,3.814516129032258,2.870967741935484,6.0,0.6854838709677419,0.0967741935483871,0.06451612903225806,0.03225806451612903,0.12903225806451613,0.016129032258064516,0.14516129032258066,0.16129032258064516,0.08064516129032258,0.04838709677419355,0.07258064516129033

I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

It shows everything in science is not correct and there is still much for us to learn. It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct.

With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

I feel for all these people that are now injured and have to go hours away for medical help because they had to shut this hospital down.,0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,99,51.21,63.96,50.45,10.27,16.5,16.16,94.95,70.71,62.63,12.12,5.05,2.02,0.0,1.01,0.0,2.02,7.07,19.19,7.07,0.0,15.15,11.11,7.07,7.07,1.01,19.19,3.03,3.03,7.07,5.05,0.0,2.02,12.12,1.01,11.11,4.04,2.02,4.04,1.01,0.0,2.02,0.0,11.11,5.05,6.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.17,8.08,6.06,0.0,1.01,2.02,0.0,8.08,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.03,3.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.05,4.04,2.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.01,4.04,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.0,8.08,12.12,0.0,2.02,9.09,0.0,0.0,2.02,3.03,3.03,9.09,2.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.06,6.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,3.97979797979798,2.808080808080808,5.828282828282828,0.9595959595959596,0.09090909090909091,0.030303030303030304,0.050505050505050504,0.1111111111111111,0.020202020202020204,0.1414141414141414,0.1111111111111111,0.12121212121212122,0.030303030303030304,0.0707070707070707

The fact that he tried to say nothing every happened it was consentual and basically blaming the victims is beyond me. He tried to say he was already convicted because the news storys but it was his own behavior. You can't go around doing what you please to other people and hurting them for your own pleasure. I am so glad someone had the courage to speak up and stop this guy from hurting more women. In most cases you cant always be sure if the women is telling the truth or just getting back at a guy but multiple women coming forward you just have to believe this guy is a danger to society.

It is so sad that people need to keep children home just to line up to get food. They also cant afford to send them lunch and the government isnt stepping in to help which would be a good investment as they are the future of there society.Someone needs to step in send aid as teachers can only do so much they need to demand others to help out.

I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed.
