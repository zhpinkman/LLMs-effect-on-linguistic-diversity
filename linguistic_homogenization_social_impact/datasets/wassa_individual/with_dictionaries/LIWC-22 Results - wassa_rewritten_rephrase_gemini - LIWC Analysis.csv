Did you read the article about the police dog, Lina, who died in a hot car in Arkansas? The handler left Lina in the car for 38 hours, resulting in her death on Friday. The Sheriff has placed the handler on paid administrative leave while an investigation is conducted. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was actively involved in drug investigations.

This incident deeply disturbs me. It's incomprehensible how someone could forget a large police dog in a car and not hear them for such an extended period. The blatant disregard for animals and humans in society is beyond my understanding. Sadly, this year alone, 82 children and numerous animals have lost their lives due to neglect.

I refuse to accept the lame excuses that are often given in these situations.",-0.488083502,1.7937063589534057,-1.574569756,0.7598387432244759,n,y,n,y,1,137,84.96,61.74,61.35,1.88,15.22,21.17,86.13,62.77,50.36,10.22,5.84,2.19,0.0,0.73,0.73,1.46,4.38,16.79,10.22,2.19,13.87,8.03,4.38,3.65,0.73,14.6,5.84,3.65,5.11,0.0,0.0,5.11,9.49,0.0,9.49,2.92,2.19,0.73,1.46,0.0,0.73,0.73,4.38,0.73,3.65,0.73,0.0,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.73,0,9.49,2.19,0.0,0.0,0.73,0.73,0.0,6.57,0.0,0.0,0.73,0.0,2.19,0.0,0.0,2.19,3.65,0.0,0.0,2.92,0.73,0.0,2.92,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.46,13.14,1.46,0.73,9.49,0.0,0.73,0.73,5.11,6.57,5.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,12.41,5.84,4.38,0.73,0.0,1.46,0.0,0,4.284671532846716,3.4306569343065694,6.729927007299271,0.9854014598540146,0.043795620437956206,0.043795620437956206,0.021897810218978103,0.051094890510948905,0.014598540145985401,0.11678832116788321,0.11678832116788321,0.058394160583941604,0.0364963503649635,0.06569343065693431

More care should be provided to these children, as their lives are often difficult from the moment they enter the system.

It is unfair that some families cannot afford to send their children to school with lunch or that they have to keep them home to wait in line for food assistance. The government should step in and provide more support for these families, as investing in children is investing in the future of society. Teachers can only do so much to help hungry children, and they need others to step up and provide assistance.",0.1018663960280084,-0.363168457,0.4159094385553915,-0.031763596,y,n,y,n,1,102,58.5,82.38,26.78,20.23,20.4,19.61,99.02,70.59,58.82,12.75,6.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.86,5.88,9.8,1.96,0.0,21.57,10.78,2.94,8.82,1.96,17.65,7.84,2.94,5.88,2.94,1.96,0.98,11.76,0.0,11.76,0.98,0.98,5.88,1.96,0.0,4.9,0.0,5.88,2.94,2.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,22.55,7.84,3.92,0.0,0.0,0.98,0.0,14.71,1.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.98,0.98,0.0,0.0,5.88,0.0,0.98,4.9,1.96,0.0,4.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.9,0.0,5.88,0.0,0.0,1.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.96,12.75,0.98,1.96,9.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.94,0.0,9.8,3.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,8.82,4.9,3.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,4.303921568627451,3.362745098039216,6.7745098039215685,0.8921568627450981,0.049019607843137254,0.0784313725490196,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.06862745098039216,0.14705882352941177,0.24509803921568626,0.049019607843137254,0.00980392156862745,0.12745098039215685
