I wanted to bring to your attention an article I came across this morning. It discusses a distressing incident in Arkansas where a police dog named Lina tragically lost her life due to being left in a hot car. The handler responsible has been placed on paid administrative leave while an investigation takes place.

Lina had been a valuable member of the sheriff's office for three years, assisting in numerous drug investigations. It is shocking to learn that she was left unattended in the car for a staggering 38 hours. How is it possible to forget such a large police dog and not hear her for that long? It is truly unbelievable.

This incident deeply disturbs me as it highlights the blatant disregard society sometimes has for both animals and humans. It is beyond my comprehension to understand such negligence. Sadly, this is not an isolated case, as we have already seen the tragic deaths of 82 children and too many animals this year.
