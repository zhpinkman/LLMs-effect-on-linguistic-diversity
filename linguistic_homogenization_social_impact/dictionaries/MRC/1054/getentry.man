NAME
     getentry - find entries for  a  set  of  words  in  the  MRC
     Psycholinguistic Database

SYNOPSIS
     getentry _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     This utility will select the full entries in the  dictionary
     that  correspond  to  an alphabetically sorted list of words
     (one word per line) in a file, when given the name  of  that
     file. The entries are output to standard output.

     For example:

     _g_e_t_e_n_t_r_y _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e._i_n > _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e._o_u_t

     will produce the entries for the alphabetically sorted words
     in  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e._i_n  if  they were present in the dictionary, in
     the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e._o_u_t.

     Although it is possible to  use  _g_r_e_p(_1),  to  perform  such
     searches, this utility is faster, since it only searches the
     WORD field in the dictionary, and can accept a  longer  list
     of words for searching.

     The input file should be alphabetically sorted before  using
     this utility. This can be achieved by using the _s_o_r_t(_1) com-
     mand.
