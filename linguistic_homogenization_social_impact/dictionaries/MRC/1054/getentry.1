.SH NAME
getentry \- find entries for a set of words in the MRC Psycholinguistic Database 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B getentry 
.I filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility will select the full entries in the dictionary that correspond to an
alphabetically sorted list
of words (one word per line) in a file, when given the name of that file. The entries
are output to standard output.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.I
getentry filename.in > filename.out
.PP
will produce the entries for the alphabetically sorted words in 
.I filename.in
if they were present in the dictionary, in the file 
.I filename.out.
.PP
Although it is possible to use 
.I grep(1),
to perform such searches, this utility is faster, since it only searches the WORD
field in the dictionary, and can accept a longer list of words for searching.
.PP
The input file should be alphabetically sorted before using this utility. This 
can be achieved by using the 
.I sort(1)
command.
