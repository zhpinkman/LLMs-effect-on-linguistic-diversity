NAME
     PsychDict - reduce MRC Psycholinguistic Database

SYNOPSIS
     PsychDict

DESCRIPTION
     The full MRC Psycholinguistic Database dictionary of  150837
     entries  occupies  11MByte  of  disc space. This may be more
     than many potential users are willing to spare. The  program
     PsychDict  reduces the dictionary to containing only entries
     for words about which  there  is  psychological  information
     available.  That  is, which have entries for any of the fre-
     quency counts, FAM, CONC, IMAG, MEANC, MEANP  or  AOA.  This
     reduced  dictionary  will  contain  most  of the information
     required for the preperation  of  psycholinguistic  stimuli,
     although it will not offer a complete word list or syntactic
     core. Similar samples for these items  can  be  produced  by
     using _d_i_c_t with the -_e_n_t_r_y option.

     The program directs output to the standard output, and  will
     produce  a file of about 3MByte containing entries for 39300
     words. An example command line would be:

     _P_s_y_c_h_D_i_c_t > _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e


OPTIONS
     _n_o_n_e
