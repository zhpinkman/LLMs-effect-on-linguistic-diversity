DESCRIPTION
     The _d_i_c_t program provides access to themachine  usable  dic-
     tionary file of the MRC Psycholinguistic Database.

     The file contains information about a variety of  word  pro-
     perties  (spelling,  pronunciation, syntactic category, fre-
     quency and others).  The file is  based  around  the  150837
     words  extracted  from various dictionaries. The composition
     of this file is described in the documents listed under 'SEE
     ALSO'.

     This program acts as a filter on the database.  The  proper-
     ties of the filter are specified by flags on the input line.
     There are two stages to the  filter:  output  selection  and
     restriction of category.

     A subset of words can be selected  from  the  total  set  of
     150837 words which fall within specified numerical ranges of
     the properties of words classified in the  database.  There-
     fore,  a  maximum  and minimum value can be given for a pro-
     perty and the words with values  listed  which  fall  within
     those  bounds will be output. Specific codes can be selected
     or excluded for ordinal scaled  properties.  Ranges  can  be
     specified  for  any  number of word properties. If no ranges
     are specified, the maximum range will be assumed acceptable.
     Therefore,  if  no ranges are given, the entire file will be
     output. Not every  property  is  recorded  for  every  word,
     therefore  words  without  a known value for a property will
     have a null value recorded. To understand the fields see the
     documents in 'SEE ALSO'.

     The filter can output either the entire record for  a  word,
     or  any set of the properties. For example, the spelling and
     Kucera and Francis frequency could be output for words which
     fall within a specified frequency range.

     Experimental stimulus files can be  constructed  using  this
     filter  in  conjunction  with  _u_n_i_q(1), _g_r_e_p(1), _s_o_r_t(1) and
     other UNIX and UNIX|STAT filters.

     Flags may be entered in any order. The -entry flag is incom-
     patible  with any other output selection flag. Otherwise any
     combination of flags is acceptable. The order of each output
     field  is  set,  and is not dependent on the order of output
     selection flags. The filter writes  to  standard  output  by

     default.

     The -File flag allows the use of any input file  other  than
     the default dictionary. The input file must contain complete
     records for each entry. Such files can be created  by  using
     the -entry flag for output redirected to a file.

     Each flag on the command line must be  separated  by  spaces
     from  others and its argument if it has one. For example, to
     select nouns with Kucera and Francis frequencies between 100
     and  500, with between 3 and 6 phonemes and a meaningfulness
     on the Pavio measure of between 500 and 700,  which  are  of
     standard  usage  according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary,
     and  to  output  only   the   words   to   a   file   called
