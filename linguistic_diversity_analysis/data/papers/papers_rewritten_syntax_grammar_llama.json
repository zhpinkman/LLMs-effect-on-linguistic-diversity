Furthermore, a contrastive learning stage is devised to utilize pixels with unreliable predictions, resulting in a more compact target feature distribution.\n\nExtensive experiments on a cross-modality medical segmentation task demonstrate the superiority of our method in large domain discrepancy settings, outperforming state-of-the-art SFDA approaches and even some UDA methods.

During each cycle from bright to dark, pixels imaging a flickering light source generate numerous events that provide little or no useful information for a robot, overwhelming the useful data in the scene. This paper proposes a novel linear filter to preprocess event data, effectively removing unwanted flicker events from an event stream. The proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, exceeding 4.6 times that of the raw event stream, due to the effective removal of flicker from fluorescent lighting. Consequently, it is ideally suited for robotics applications operating in indoor settings or scenes illuminated by flickering light sources.\n}"}, "2205.00627": {"original_text": "  White matter fiber clustering is an important strategy for white matter\nparcellation, which enables quantitative analysis of brain connections in\nhealth and disease.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdapterSoup consistently improves performance on new domains without requiring additional training. Furthermore, we explore weight averaging of adapters trained on the same domain with different hyperparameters, and show that it preserves the performance of a PLM on new domains while achieving strong in-domain results. We investigate various approaches for selecting which adapters to combine, including text clustering and semantic similarity. Our results indicate that using clustering leads to the most competitive results on novel domains.\n}"}, "1706.09147": {"original_text": "  We address the task of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) for noisy text.

We demonstrate that this model can be fine-tuned to accommodate new input conditions, resulting in a diffusion operator. By working directly over image embeddings, we not only improve our ability to learn semantic operations but also enable the direct use of a textual CLIP loss as additional supervision when needed.

Extensive experiments on two synthesized and one real-world different-resolution CD datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method significantly outperforms several vanilla CD methods and two cross-resolution CD methods on the three datasets, both in in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. The empirical results suggest that our method can yield relatively consistent HR change predictions regardless of varying bitemporal resolution ratios.

In this work, we focus on investigating models' commonsense inference capabilities from two perspectives: (1) whether models can determine if the knowledge they possess is sufficient to solve the task; and (2) whether models can develop commonsense inference capabilities that generalize across various commonsense tasks. To achieve this, we first align commonsense tasks with relevant knowledge from commonsense knowledge bases and ask humans to annotate whether the knowledge is sufficient or not. Then, we convert different commonsense tasks into a unified question-answering format to evaluate models' generalization capabilities.

To address this, we develop SAM with semantic feature fusion guidance (Sammese), which incorporates multi-modal saliency-specific knowledge into SAM to adapt it to multi-modal SOD tasks.\n\nHowever, it is difficult for SAM, trained on single-modal data, to directly mine the complementary benefits of multi-modal inputs and comprehensively utilize them to achieve accurate saliency prediction. To address these issues, we design a multi-modal complementary fusion module to extract robust multi-modal semantic features by integrating information from visible and thermal or depth image pairs.\n\nThen, we feed the extracted multi-modal semantic features into both the SAM image encoder and mask decoder for fine-tuning and prompting, respectively. Specifically, in the image encoder, a multi-modal adapter is proposed to adapt the single-modal SAM to multi-modal information. In the mask decoder, a semantic-geometric prompt generation strategy is proposed to produce corresponding embeddings with various saliency cues.\n\nExtensive experiments on both RGB-D and RGB-T SOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

We identify several key factors, including text prompts, classifier-free guidance scale, and types of text-to-image models, that significantly impact scaling behavior. After tuning these factors, we observe that synthetic images exhibit a scaling trend similar to, but slightly less effective than, real images in CLIP training, while they significantly underperform in scaling when training supervised image classifiers. Our analysis reveals that the primary reason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf text-to-image models to generate certain concepts, a limitation that significantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Furthermore, our findings suggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenarios such as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervised problem (e.g., fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet), (2) when the evaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data, indicating an out-of-distribution scenario, or (3) when synthetic data is used in conjunction with real images, as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models.\n}"}, "1909.1244": {"original_text": "  Recently, pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success in a\nbroad range of natural language processing tasks.

Intuitively, NLI should rely more on multiple perspectives to form a holistic view, thereby eliminating bias. \n\nIn this paper, we propose the Multi-Perspective Inferrer (MPI), a novel NLI model that reasons relationships from multiple perspectives associated with the three relationships. The MPI determines the perspectives of different parts of the sentences via a routing-by-agreement policy and makes the final decision from a holistic view. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary supervised signal to ensure that the MPI learns the expected perspectives. \n\nExperiments on SNLI and MultiNLI demonstrate that (1) the MPI achieves substantial improvements over the base model, verifying the motivation of multi-perspective inference; (2) visualized evidence confirms that the MPI learns highly interpretable perspectives as expected; and (3) more importantly, the MPI is architecture-free and compatible with the powerful BERT."}, "2403.04212": {"original_text": "  Providing emotional support through dialogue systems is becoming increasingly\nimportant in today's world, as it can support both mental health and social\ninteractions in many conversation scenarios.

Inspired by the success of dictionary learning and sparse coding for vector-valued data, our goal in this paper is to represent data in the form of SPD matrices as sparse conic combinations of SPD atoms from a learned dictionary, leveraging a Riemannian geometric approach. To achieve this, we formulate a novel Riemannian optimization objective for dictionary learning and sparse coding, where the representation loss is characterized via the affine-invariant Riemannian metric. We also present a computationally efficient algorithm for optimizing our model.

We identify and evaluate the possible choices in the critical steps of unsupervised rPPG methodologies. To ensure reproducible and fair comparisons, we assess a state-of-the-art processing pipeline in six different datasets, incorporating important corrections in the methodology. Furthermore, we extend the pipeline by proposing three novel ideas: (1) a new method to stabilize the detected face based on rigid mesh normalization, (2) a new method to dynamically select the optimal facial regions that provide the best raw signals, and (3) a new RGB-to-rPPG transformation method, called Orthogonal Matrix Image Transformation (OMIT), based on QR decomposition, which increases robustness against compression artifacts. Our results show that all three changes introduce noticeable improvements in retrieving rPPG signals from faces, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to unsupervised, non-learning-based methodologies and, in some databases, approaching the performance of supervised, learning-based methods. We perform a comparative study to quantify the contribution of each proposed idea and provide a series of observations that could inform future implementations.\n}"}, "1803.05449": {"original_text": "  We introduce SentEval, a toolkit for evaluating the quality of universal\nsentence representations.
