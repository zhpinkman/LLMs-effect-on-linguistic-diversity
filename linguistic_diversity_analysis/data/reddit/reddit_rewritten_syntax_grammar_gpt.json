I've seen you. You've brought joy to so many faces. You've helped people when they've needed it most. Especially...them. Turn around. Say your goodbyes. They love you. You love them, too. Three, two, one... It's done. You are dead. Right! Time to introduce myself. I don't really have a name...well, I do, but I'm a bit shy about it. Call me C, for short. If you like. Hi! I'm your new friend. That is, if you like, of course. I'd like to be your new friend. Would you like to be mine? OK! Great! Well, then, come on, friend! Let me show you around. Look - you can look down and see... There they are, look! One day, you'll meet them up here, too. They still love you. Never forget that. They love you now, and they always will...

You have lived a fulfilling life. I have observed you. You have brought happiness to many faces and provided assistance when it was most needed, particularly to them. Please turn around and bid your farewells. They hold great affection for you. You reciprocate that love. Three, two, one... It is over. You have passed away. Now, allow me to introduce myself. I do not have a specific name, or rather, I am hesitant to share it. You may refer to me as C, if you wish. Hello! I am your new companion, should you desire. I would like to establish a friendship with you. Would you be open to that? Wonderful! In that case, let us proceed, my friend. Allow me to guide you. Look down - there they are.

The truth is, I don\u2019t work in the sales department at the Macy\u2019s downtown. Where I do work doesn\u2019t matter, but there was a break-in today, much worse than anything we\u2019ve experienced. This was the only thing I could think of doing. By the time you receive this message, I\u2019ll most likely be dead. I\u2019m sorry and I love you, Dad \u2026 Timothy Clarke peered at the plain brown paper box sitting open in his hands before turning back to the letter. It was printed on standard office paper. A confused look on his face, he turned back to the box. The package had been delivered earlier by a local deliver service. Inside the cardboard sat a smaller metal container with a clasp on one side. On top was printed the number 1356, otherwise the container had no other distinguishing markings. He set the item down on the counter and read through the brief note again. \u201cWhat kind of joke is this, old man,\u201d he muttered. He knew his father was distant at the best of times and had largely written the man out of his life. Never had he expected to receive a letter from his father, much less this strange package. The tone of the letter was strange as well. If it was not the middle of summer, he would have checked to see if this was some bizarre April Fool\u2019s joke. He set the letter aside with a shake of his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this anyway?\u201d He pulled the metal box out of the carboard shipping container and set it on the counter. The latch clicked open easily enough and the top opened without a sound. \u201cWhat a bad joke,\u201d he said with a scowl. \u201cSaying you\u2019re dead and sending this. I\u2019m going to punch him next time I see him\u2026\u201d On a molded velvet cushion sat a bright yellow rubber duck, the kind small children would take into a bathtub to keep them company. He took it out and inspected it. Yes, it was a rubber duckie. He squeezed it and it let out a slight squeak. He put it back down and picked up the letter, scanning it for the umpteenth time in minutes. \u201cMaybe mom will know.\u201d He set the letter aside. Glancing at the duck again, he picked it up with a sigh. He felt like a complete fool for taking the toy but considering his father had never sent him anything before, this was an oddity at the very least. Setting it on his bedside table, he went about the rest of the day. Later, his mother would confirm that she had no idea why the man would be contacting them after all these years. He had all but put it out of his mind that night when a loud crash sent him shooting straight up in bed. \u201cWhat?\u201d He muttered, mind still hazy from sleep. There were heavy footsteps downstairs, as if multiple people had entered the small home where he and his mother lived. \u201cSearch the rooms. It must be somewhere in here,\u201d a deep voice commanded. He froze. They were being robbed. His body tensed as his eyes scanned the room for a weapon to use. The door to his mother\u2019s room opened and his eyes widened in shock. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Who are you?!\u201d He heard his mother shout. There was a gunshot and a thud. Tim\u2019s heart was pounding as his eyes remained fixed on the door. \u201cDispose of that,\u201d the same cold voice ordered. More footsteps could be heard as well as the sound of something heavy being thrown down the stairs. Then, the doorknob to his room began to turn. The moment it started opening, Tim acted. \u201cWhat the \u2013 \u201d came a muffled voice as he slammed into the door, closing it again. \u201cThe hell you doin\u2019, Jenkins?\u201d He heard on the other side of the door. Then, the door was kicked open, sending him flying back in a cloud of wood shrapnel. He hit his nightstand with a cry. \u201cTarget in sight. Removing the witness.\u201d Tim\u2019s eyes widened as the barrel of an automatic rifle was trained on him. At the same time, there was a light thump as a plain yellow duck fell into his hand. He squeezed instinctually, waiting for death to come. The duck let out its innocent squeak. There was a choking noise and a thud. Tim\u2019s eyes shot open and he saw the form of a man lying on his bedroom floor. For some reason, he appeared as if he were deflated. What bits of skin he could see were dried and almost mummified. \u201cSir! Power activation registered!\u201d Another voice called from outside his bedroom. Once again, footsteps stormed up the stairs, coming towards his position. Without thinking, he squeezed the duck again as another intruder rounded the corner. The man skidded to a halt as well. \u201cRetreat! Retreat!\u201d There was a rush of movement and after a few tense moments, the house was quiet. When it was clear no one else was coming, Tim got to his knees. Shakily, he crawled over to the first body in his room. As he suspected the man was completely dried. He moved turned the face a bit too quickly and the head snapped clean off the body, rolling into a corner like some grotesque bowling ball. Time let out yelp and scooted back a few inches. He stared from the duck in his hands to the two bodies nearby. \u201cJust what the hell is going on?\u201d ... Quick writing challenge.

Panic set in as he searched for a weapon, but before he could react, a gunshot rang out from his mother's room.\n\nAs the situation escalated, Tim found himself facing armed intruders in his own room. In a moment of desperation, he instinctively squeezed the rubber duck, which seemed to trigger a bizarre reaction in the attackers, causing them to retreat.

My eyes were still closed, but from the sound of his words, he was clearly keeping his mouth open for effect. \"No!\" I snapped. \"Shit, fine, I'll brush our damned teeth!\" I glared angrily at the mirror as I snatched my toothbrush and applied a glob of paste before hastily brushing. Despite my own expression, my reflection looked back at me with a self-satisfied, pearly white, grin. \"You're an asshole.\" I snapped, spitting out the toothpaste and throwing my brush down in the sink. \"I'm an asshole who plans on on keeping all his teeth!\" he called after me, as I stormed out of the bathroom, and snatched up my backpack, which I'd left by the door. \"Looks like somebody's gonna be la-aaate.\" my own voice taunted me in an irritating sing-song, as I walked briskly down the hall towards the stairs. \"Oh don't you even start with me, today!\" I snarled at my shadow, the source of the voice, which was lazily loping along the wall beside me. \"You know what we need?\" my shadow continued, heedless of my ire. \"Caramel machiatto, bro! Let's hit up that little drive-thru place with the hot baristas.\" \"No! We're already going to be late enough as it is!\" I snapped. \"Exactly!\" my shadow responded, smoothly. \"Plus it's the first day of the semester -- class is just gonna be a bunch of bullshit, and a syllabus you can download later anyway. You need to energize and de-stress more than you need that. Self-care, bro -- ever heard of it?\" \"Blowing off the class that I'm going into thousands of dollars in debt to attend isn't 'self-care'.\" I dismissed, with a roll of my eyes. A second later, I stumbled and almost fell, as my legs suddenly became heavy. I looked at the wall. \"Not this again...\" I groaned. I was standing up, but my shadow had gone limp and prone. I could still move when he made me drag him like that, but it was difficult, and more importantly at the moment, it slowed me down considerably. \"Come on!\" \"Compromise.\" my shadow suggested, still unmoving. \"Stop at the coffee counter in the student services building on your way to class.\" He raised a pointed finger, as if an important thought had just occurred to him. \"And image search 'hot barista' on your phone. Safe search off, bro.\" I clenched my fists and inhaled deeply, preparing to verbally tear my shadow a new penumbra. I cut my tirade off before it began. I couldn't go back to the constant fighting I'd done with these two, in the past. That had landed me in the hospital for psychiatric evaluation more than once, in my teens. Inconvenient and annoying as they could be, working with them and making little compromises usually turned out better than fighting them. Both my shadow and reflection were, after all, trying to help; albeit in their own lopsided, contradictory ways. \"Fine. Deal.\" I hissed, through gritted teeth. My shadow immediately kipped up onto his feet from the floor, and broke into a jog. I followed suit. There was an upside to Shadow, when he was cooperating with what I wanted to do. With Shadow matching my movements, I felt like I was capable of anything. Instead of feeling heavy, I felt light, energetic, and full of stamina. I had to be careful, though -- that feeling could become addictive, and lead to me following my shadow's lead, instead of the other way around. I practically flew out the front door, and slid into my car in one fluid motion. I didn't have to worry about Shadow for a while, as the early morning light wasn't casting him inside the confines of my car. That was good -- Shadow rarely had good ideas about how to safely operate a motor vehicle. I glanced in the rear view mirror. Reflection sat in the back seat, his arms crossed. \"A caramel macchiato?\" he asked, raising a disapproving eyebrow. \"How many grams of sugar is that? Guess I shouldn't have bothered getting you to brush, since you're determined to rot the teeth out of our head, no matter what I do.\" \"Would you just leave me alone?\" I pleaded. \"I brushed my teeth, I combed my hair, I'm going to class -- you like all that stuff!\" \"It'll do, I suppose.\" he conceded, and then was blessedly silent. That lasted about two minutes, before I heard him again, from the back seat. \"Hey, you ever wonder what we're going to look like, when we're morbidly obese? You know, when all that junk food you shove in our face, and all the sugary coffee drinks you suck down our throat, finally catches up to us, in ten or twelve years?

You are the only other being who might possess his knowledge.\" I kept my gaze fixed on the floor, a faint smile playing at the corners of my mouth. \"Ah, yes. The lost child is lost once more, wandering with his companions and his box,\" I remarked as I rose from the knee I had taken before His Excellence. \"Not as reliable as you had hoped, it seems.\" The old man's face flushed as he lit a cigar to compose himself before repeating his question with deliberate precision. \"How long has it been since the clocks stopped?\" I met his gaze mischievously. \"Quite some time.\" His face reddened once more, and he reached for the intercom on his desk. \"You have one final chance. I will not ask again.\" Glancing at the intercom, I decided not to push my luck any further and resolved to answer his query, as I also had questions for him.\n\n\"To address your question, I will share a tale\u2014\" He raised a hand to interrupt me, but I cut him off abruptly. \"You did not request it, but you shall receive it if you desire an answer.\" After a moment of defiance, he settled down, acknowledging that he needed my knowledge as much as I needed his goodwill. Both of us stood to gain from our conversation without resorting to groveling for our respective objectives.\n\n\"Imagine a man consumed by guilt, driven nearly to madness by an unavoidable decision. A decision that left him as the sole survivor, burdened with the knowledge of its inevitability. The guilt does not merely plague his thoughts or disturb his sleep; it propels him to flee, staying one step ahead of its relentless pursuit.\" The old man was captivated by my narrative, realizing that our missing friend had kept his secrets this time. \"He is a fugitive from his own conscience, running aimlessly without considering the consequences of his actions. He weaves tales of 'fixed points' and 'fluid time' as excuses for his meddling, endangering us all. I know this because I witnessed it firsthand. I can tell you when the clocks last moved, for I have tracked him here, navigating the temporal fabric with precision. Time and history unfold beyond these walls, and I am determined to intervene.\"\n\nI leaned in closer, pressing a specialized device against the old man's neck, a gesture that conveyed the gravity of my words. \"I possess knowledge that you may find unbelievable, Prime Minister. You were the last to see your soothsayer before his disappearance, indicating that you know his whereabouts.

The director looks around his office with a worried expression before slowly reaching under his desk to press a button. I worry that it will summon the guards or dump me down a trap door for daring to ask such a politically sensitive topic. Yet the window shutters roll down and the door to the room bolts shut. A strange light dances around the room before a computer voice announces \u201cRoom Secure, Level 5 lockdown in place.\u201d The director then turns his attention to me and turns one of his computer screens so that I can see it. \u201cWe have solved most of those problems time and time again. The true problem is human nature. As you know, being two hundred and fifty years old like yourself is considered young. Millennia ago when we first started to leave our home world, the equivalent age was a mere twenty-five years of age.\u201d He shows me a graph of the average life expectancy of humans over the last three thousand years growing from a modest early to mid-eighties to the mid eight hundreds. \u201cThe only thing holding us back from biological immortality is law. With current tech, we expect to push to a thousand at most, but with nanorobot swarms, we could gain biological immortality but, they\u2019re one of the few technologies we consider forbidden and we\u2019ve weaponized temporal paradoxes.\u201d The director says before closing his eyes and sighing softly. I nod as I listen to the explanation. Of course, everyone knows you can only hold off the effects of entropy for so long. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d I shudder at the thought of an uncontained nanite cloud gorging on materials to make more clouds. The director reaches into his desk to take out a bottle of brown liquid and two small glass cups. \u201cThe millennia of warfare against the galactic alliance has caused irreparable damage to our society and culture. Most information on how we used to live was lost and what remains is known to only the few authorized to know our true history. You\u2019re my chosen successor so I\u2019m going to be instructing you on what we lost, how we lost it and how we tried and failed to regain it.\u201d He explains as he brings up more information about the history of the galaxy. \u201cHumanity has always been a violent race ever since our birth. As we advanced, our methods of war grew advanced until we had two world wars in the twentieth century and a third in the twenty-first. After the Second World War, we started to transition over to sports, a form of ritualized combat to satisfy our urges and just before the start of the third we started to use virtual combat to fill our urges for violence.\u201d While speaking he pours a shot of the brown liquid into each of the cups. With a sombre expression, he continues and shows me some ancient video of two warships clashing in space. \u201cOur ancestors thought that leaving behind the space constraints of the earth would stop us from warring over territory but, people still chose to fight. This time over who got to rule who. In the end, the colony wars ended when we contacted the galactic alliance. Everything went well until the long war started.\u201d The director shows a video of a bunch of aliens forcing a group of humans to dig ore in a mine. \u201cThe Beleano claimed one of our colonies and enslaved our citizens. We protested to the alliance but, they took the side of the Beleano claiming that as an older species, they had priority and that our laws against slavery ended at our borders.\u201d He closes his eyes and rubs them slowly. \u201cHumanity did not agree with this. We got our citizens back and started a war with the Beleano who called on the alliance for assistance. Overnight we became the galactic equivalent of old Earth\u2019s Iran or North Korea, a pariah state.\u201d After finishing he takes his cup and almost throws the contents into his mouth. I gasped in shock. \u201cSo, that\u2019s how the long war started. I thought it was lost to history\u2026 That does not explain the poverty or disease though.\u201d I say before downing my shot, shuddering as the alcohol burns my throat.\u201d \u201cThat part is human nature. Unlike the twenty-first century where in many parts of the world if you did not work you would starve and be unable to access medical care, everyone is now entitled to basic food and medical care. We are postindustrial, and almost all work is automated. We only work because the network intelligences feel that work gives us purpose and they give each of us work that best suits our capabilities. In return for work, we get credits that can be traded with the intelligences for things beyond basic needs like luxuries. The problem is many people don\u2019t like being told what to do by either human or synthetic intelligence.\u201d He explains. \u201cHonestly, the disease is our fault though. Most of it is lab leaks from biological weapons projects with the rest being from poor quarantine of people traveling between planets. Earth is unique though. Being our home world most animal life shares some genetic material with us and diseases that infect the local wildlife there can easily infect a human compared to diseases that evolved to infect an alien biochemistry.\u201d I just nod in stunned silence as I think through what the director just told me. So much of what I thought I knew about the world was far different in reality. The director pats me on the shoulder and then smiles. \u201cEven though our true history is kept secret, one only needs to ask for permission to learn. Why do you have to ask? Because those who do ask why the world is the way that it is are the humans that the synthetic intelligences prefer to work with to run out society, humans who care about their fellow human and not their bank balance or influence.\u201d", "rewritten_text": "I gaze at the director, my expression reflecting confusion. \"So, we have developed weapons capable of detonating stars like fireworks, compressing dimensions, and altering time. Yet, we continue to grapple with age-old issues such as poverty, disease, and aging, which should theoretically be solvable with the resources and technology we employ to create these weapons,\" I inquire, my face betraying my bewilderment. The director surveys his office with a troubled look before slowly reaching under his desk to press a button. Anxious thoughts race through my mind, fearing that I may be summoned by guards or dropped through a trap door for daring to broach such a politically sensitive topic. However, instead of those scenarios, the window shutters descend, and the room's door locks securely. A peculiar light dances around the room as a computerized voice announces, \"Room Secure, Level 5 lockdown in place.\" The director then redirects his focus towards me, pivoting one of his computer screens for my viewing. \"We have, in fact, addressed many of those challenges repeatedly. The fundamental issue lies in human nature. As you are aware, at two hundred and fifty years old, you are considered young. Millennia ago, when we first ventured beyond our home planet, the equivalent age was a mere twenty-five years,\" he explains, displaying a graph illustrating the average human life expectancy over the past three thousand years, evolving from a modest early-to-mid-eighties to the mid-eight hundreds. \"The primary obstacle preventing us from achieving biological immortality is legislation. With current technology, we anticipate extending life to a maximum of a thousand years. However, with the utilization of nanorobot swarms, biological immortality could be within reach. Unfortunately, nanorobots are among the few technologies deemed forbidden, and we have weaponized temporal paradoxes,\" the director elaborates before closing his eyes and emitting a soft sigh. I nod in comprehension as I absorb his explanation, acknowledging the inevitable limitations imposed by entropy. \"That is a logical perspective,\" I remark, shuddering at the notion of uncontrolled nanite proliferation. The director retrieves a bottle of brown liquid and two small glass cups from his desk. \"The millennia of conflict with the galactic alliance have inflicted irreparable harm upon our society and culture. Much of our historical knowledge has been lost, with only a select few authorized to access our true heritage. As my chosen successor, I will impart to you the knowledge of our losses, failures, and attempts at recovery,\" he discloses, presenting further insights into the galaxy's history. \"Humanity has always exhibited a propensity for violence since its inception. Our warfare tactics evolved alongside our technological advancements, culminating in two world wars during the twentieth century and a third in the twenty-first. Following the Second World War, we transitioned to sports as a form of ritualized combat to satiate our aggressive impulses. Just prior to the onset of the third war, virtual combat emerged as an outlet for our violent tendencies,\" he narrates while pouring the brown liquid into the cups. With a solemn expression, he continues, showcasing ancient footage of space warships engaging in battle. \"Our ancestors believed that transcending Earth's spatial confines would quell territorial disputes, yet conflict persisted, this time revolving around power dynamics. The colony wars ceased upon our contact with the galactic alliance. However, the prolonged conflict ensued,\" the director illustrates, displaying a video depicting aliens coercing humans into mining activities. \"The Beleano seized one of our colonies and enslaved our populace. Despite our protests to the alliance, they sided with the Beleano, asserting their seniority as a species and disregarding our anti-slavery laws beyond our borders,\" he recounts, closing his eyes and massaging them wearily. \"Humanity dissented. We reclaimed our citizens and engaged in war with the Beleano, who sought assistance from the alliance. Overnight, we became the galactic equivalent of Earth's historical pariah states, such as Iran or North Korea,\" he concludes, raising his cup and nearly consuming its contents in one swift motion. I gasp in astonishment. \"So, that is how the long war commenced. I had believed it to be lost to history... However, that does not explain the persistence of poverty or disease,\" I interject before downing my shot, feeling the fiery burn of the alcohol in my throat. \"The root of those issues lies in human nature. Unlike the twenty-first century, where individuals faced starvation and lacked access to medical care if they did not work, everyone now receives basic sustenance and healthcare as entitlements. We have transitioned to a postindustrial society, with the majority of labor being automated. Work is assigned to us by network intelligences, who believe it provides us with purpose, and in return, we earn credits that can be exchanged for non-essential items beyond basic necessities. However, many individuals resist being dictated to by either human or synthetic intelligence,\" he elucidates. \"Regrettably, diseases are predominantly our own doing. Most stem from laboratory leaks related to biological weapons projects, with additional cases arising from inadequate quarantine measures for interplanetary travelers. Earth, being our homeworld, shares genetic similarities with much of its animal life, rendering humans susceptible to diseases that infect local wildlife more readily than those targeting alien biochemistries,\" he continues. I remain silent, absorbing the director's revelations and reassessing my understanding of the world. He offers a comforting pat on my shoulder before smiling. \"Although our true history remains shrouded in secrecy, access to this knowledge is attainable upon request. The inquisitive individuals questioning the world's state are the humans favored by synthetic intelligences to oversee our society\u2014individuals who prioritize compassion over wealth or influence,\" he concludes."}, "t1_dt337kd": {"original_text": "We wanted her near family, the first time.

I'll never be strong enough to watch as my baby girl is lowered into a hole in the ground. I'll always find myself shivering, fighting the urge to beat them all back and snatch up the coffin, to scream that they've got it wrong, that she'll be all right! She's just got cold, damn it!

What could be so important?\" Boris began to question, only to be interrupted by Yuri, who asserted, \"Everything. He knows everything about each person present here, Boris.

With my \u2018Blink\u2019 teleport powers, I hopped around the nooks and crannies till I could see the carriage with my target inside. I just needed a quick glance inside then boom; I could be there. The curtain fluttered a bit, and I saw my opening. With a final blink, I vanished in a flash of light and appeared inside the carriage. I had already prepared my one-liner for the perfect heroic assassination. \u201cSorry to pop in, I thought I\u2019d just-\u201d a loud clack sounded out as a mana-suppressing manacle was locked around my wrist. Rather than the Emperor, I was greeted by a quartet of heavily armoured knights from the imperial guard. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, sir Bast. We were more than ready to welcome such an esteemed guest.\u201d the voice of the Imperial Captain replies to my already lost one-liner. The damn bastard was quick on the quip. Regardless I had my\u2026 where\u2019s my metal rending knife? Looking around the carriage, I can see Thomalous admiring the blade. When had he\u2026? Thinking about it now, It really was too easy. To think an opening perfect for one such as myself would show itself. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask my captors. \u201cHuh? Oh, we\u2019re off to see the boss In the Dread Castle. He\u2019s interested in you, you know.\u201d the Guard Captain replies. \u201cThe Dread Castle,\u201d I nearly choke as I repeat his words. This is bad. Like very, very bad. I need to get out of this situation. \u201cSay, boys\u2026\u201d I put on the most relaxed facade I can manage. \u201cHow would you like to be made filthy rich?\u201d When in doubt, bribe, bribe and bribe some more. \u201cI\u2019m ok, thank you. I receive a very fair wage for my work.\u201d the Captain refuses my offer out of hand. I glance at the other knights, who are nodding along. \u201cThe Evil Emperor pays you well?\u201d \u201cWell, obviously, lad, we are his guards. What idiot doesn\u2019t pay his bodyguards well?\u201d Mike, the Guard to my left, answers with a chuckle. \u201cBut he\u2019s\u2026 you know the Evil Emperor\u2026\u201d I decide the next best bet is to try their morals. \u201cTo you rebels, maybe. To me, he took a beggar urchin from the streets. Fed me, clothed me and gave me a job. If I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t know why he insists on not punishing people for calling him that.\u201d Thomalous says. \u201cWell, he did say something about proving a point and some nonsense about free speech.\u201d the Captain explains, answering his colleague's question. Ok moral and financial attempts have failed. The best bet is probably to brute force it. Leaning forwards, I catch a glimpse of the outside and really focus my gaze. I can feel the mana flow through me. Yes, this is it. I\u2019m going\u2026 I\u2019m going nowhere. \u201cThese are good manacles,\u201d I mutter, feeling defeated. \u201cIndeed.

I suppose a bit of overkill for a human like you, but the boss was certain you needed \u2018em.\u201d the only guard not to have spoken answers me. \u201cSo what will happen to me then?\u201d \u201cBrazen Bull, I believe.\u201d the Captain's answer makes my blood run icy cold. The Brazen Bull is one of the most brutal execution methods in existence. \u201cR-really?\u201d I can\u2019t help but begin to stutter. \u201cYeah, first offence,\u201d the Captain nods. \u201cFIRST OFFENCE?!!\u201d I repeat, shocked that this is the first punishment. \u201cWell, it is your first attempt to kill the boss. Punishment matches the crime. Now quiet; we\u2019re almost there.\u201d I glance out the window, but we are still in the\u2026 Ok, we just teleported to the Castle Gate.

With all the pride and willpower I have as an honourable warrior, I throw myself at the Emperor\u2026\u2019s feet. \u201cPLEASE, SIRE, DON\u2019T KILL ME!!\u201d I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes, and snot is already flooding out my nose. Pride and Honour? Screw that; I want to live. \u201cI WILL TELL YOU WHERE ALL THE REBEL BASES ARE JUST DON\u2019T BRAZEN BULL ME!!\u201d \u201cI-Brazen?-I understand I shall be magnanimous and offer clemency in return for your full assistance.\u201d the Emperor nods at me and grants my deepest wish. I never liked those rebel guys anyway. They always offered future payments. \u2014------------------ I watched as a trio of my Knights dragged the assassin known as Bast out of my throne room. The only one remaining was my Guard Captain. I knew we were going to try and capture him and interrogate him.

I felt it prudent to get him to think his only lifeline was to surrender information. Even I didn\u2019t expect it to be that effective.\u201d \u201cI\u2026 Gunter, my reputation won\u2019t improve so long as people think of me like my father.

In hindsight, the ease with which I infiltrated the carriage seemed too good to be true.\n\nQuestioning my captors about our destination, I learned we were headed to the Dread Castle to meet their boss, who expressed interest in me. The revelation sent a chill down my spine. Desperate to escape, I attempted to bribe the guards, but they declined, citing their loyalty to the Emperor who had once rescued and provided for them.\n\nFailing to sway them morally or financially, I resorted to a futile attempt at using brute force, only to realize the manacles were designed to contain powerful beings. The guards revealed my fate - the brutal Brazen Bull execution awaited me for my first offense of attempting to kill the Emperor.\n\nAs we approached the Castle Gate, I mustered one last plan. Dragged before the Emperor, I threw myself at his feet, begging for mercy and offering information on rebel bases in exchange for my life. Surprisingly, the Emperor granted me clemency, and I abandoned my allegiance to the rebels.\n\nObserving the aftermath, I watched as my Knights escorted the defeated assassin out of the throne room, leaving only my Guard Captain behind. Reflecting on the situation, I realized the fear tactics employed had been effective, even though they misrepresented my true intentions.\n\nAcknowledging the need to dispel the misconceptions surrounding my rule, I instructed Gunter to ensure the assassin's well-being and emphasized the importance of treating prisoners with respect.

A little porn, a lot of business news, an unfortunate number of cat videos... Hell, get creative and give me a love of Donald Trump and a thing for amputees. Whatever. Just do your job. \"Mr. Smith,\" the man in the dark glasses had said to me. \"I just have one more question, about your search history.\" \"Greeeeaaat,\" I'd thought. \"Fucking Tim's probably given me an exhibitionist fetish and a thing for engineers--and now this guy thinks I'm going to streak the cubicle farm.\" But I put on my best slightly-embarrassed, serious but not overly-concerned face and said \"Yes? What about it?\" \"You don't have one.\" Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuucking Tim! That lazy bastard. His job is literally to search the web...he literally just has to search the web. Log in as Greg Smith, search the web, make sure I get out of here in one piece. Hell, he could even surf that slag heap Reddit for all I cared--as long as he searched SOMETHING. Not that hard. Alright, time to try to talk my way out. \"What do you mean?\" I'd asked innocently. \"I search all the time. Mostly business news, sometimes a cat video.\" I gave a little chuckle. \"You've never searched for anything, Mr. Smith. At all.\" He stared at me, sitting perfectly still, emotionless. \"Well, gee, this is embarrassing.\" \"Is it, Mr. Smith?\" \"Well, yeah, I...see, I use Yahoo!. I know, I know, that probably disqualifies me from the job, but it's just an old habit.\" Yahoo! was the only remaining alternative to Google, but using it wasn't criminal. Like the faux alternative parties of the old Eastern Bloc, using Yahoo! would make you as an odd outlier, but it was technically legal. I was never getting in to the company now, for sure, but at least maybe I'd make it out... The man sat silently for a long, long moment. \"You don't use Yahoo!, Mr. Smith.\" \"Of course I do, I've...\" \"We hacked Yahoo! many years ago. You don't use them.\" Fuck. Wait, did he just reveal that Google had a backdoor into Yahoo!'s search functions? That's...that's not information I should have been told--legally speaking, Yahoo! was a separate search engine. Technically, Yahoo! is why this isn't a totalitarian state--because \"you could always use Yahoo!.\" So that's not information they let out--that's information that could get a guy killed. Maybe it was a bluff. I decided to call it. \"I do use Yahoo!, I've used them for years, and...\" \"You use AltaVista, Mr. Smith. Or, should I say, you're from AltaVista. Or is it Ask Jeeves? Or some other group of revolutionaries.\" \"I'm not! I'm just here applying for a job, I'm not with the resistance!\" It was hard to keep the panic out of my voice by this point, but the goon behind me ensured I didn't make a break for it. The man in the sunglasses still didn't move. \"Mr. Smith -- or, whoever you are -- you've clearly gone to quite a lot of trouble to create a persona. It's very impressive. I honestly don't know why you went to the trouble to have facial surgery and upload a whole life, without bothering to create a search profile. Such a rookie mistake.\" For the first time, he seemed to smile a little. I sat quietly for a long minute. Then the man across the table smiled more broadly, as I saw the goon taking out his garrote... \"But it's good to know our mole Tim is still active.\"", "rewritten_text": "Tim is such a pain. The last thing I did was ask him if he had set up the search history for \"Greg Smith.\" And what was his response? He claimed he did it \"yesterday.\" But with Tim, saying \"I did it yesterday\" and \"I'm totally going to do it today unless there's some awesome anime to read later\" seem to mean the same thing. These low-rent tech guys are the reason AltaVista is barely surviving, not because Google has some secret advantage. I sensed trouble when a large man entered the room and positioned himself in front of the door without anyone signaling for him. He just appeared. How did they manage that? Perhaps one of Google's secrets, which I might have discovered if Tim had filled my search history with the usual content. A bit of porn, plenty of business news, and an unfortunate number of cat videos. Maybe even throw in a love for Donald Trump and a fascination with amputees. Just do your job, Tim.\n\n\"Mr. Smith,\" the man in dark glasses addressed me. \"I have one more question regarding your search history.\"\n\nGreat, I thought. Tim has probably given me an exhibitionist fetish and a thing for engineers, and now this guy thinks I'm going to streak through the office. But I maintained a slightly embarrassed, serious yet unconcerned expression and replied, \"Yes? What about it?\"\n\n\"You don't have one,\" he stated flatly.\n\nTim, that lazy bum. His only job is to search the web, a task as simple as it gets. Log in as Greg Smith, search the web, ensure my safety. He could even browse Reddit for all I cared, as long as he did something. Not that difficult. Time to talk my way out of this.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked innocently. \"I search all the time. Mostly business news, sometimes a cat video.\" I chuckled. \"You've never searched for anything, Mr. Smith.

I was never getting hired now, but at least I might escape.\n\nThe man remained silent for a long moment. \"You don't use Yahoo!, Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"Of course I do, I've...\"\n\n\"We hacked Yahoo! years ago. You don't use them.\" Oh no. Did he just reveal Google's backdoor into Yahoo!'s search functions? That's sensitive information. Maybe it was a bluff. I decided to challenge it.\n\n\"I do use Yahoo!, I've used them for years, and...\"\n\n\"You use AltaVista, Mr. Smith. Or, should I say, you're from AltaVista. Or Ask Jeeves?

The man in sunglasses remained unmoved. \"Mr. Smith, or whoever you are, you've gone to great lengths to create a persona. It's impressive. But why go through all that trouble without creating a search profile? Such a rookie mistake.\"\n\nHe seemed to smile slightly for the first time. I sat in silence.

Kelly asked with her usual up beat tone. \"Always ready, Lieutenant\" I answered stoically. I took a quick glance over at Johnson and nodded. He slammed a button on the lander wall and the staircased door hydraulically lowered to the Martian surface. \"We make History today fellas\" I offered to my crew. \"Houston, this is Commander Thorton, we are ready to step off. Do we have the green light?\" The radio signal beamed from my helmet to the Martian lander. From there it sprang up to a communications satellite which transformed it into near spread of light plasma pulses relayed to earth. Technology was really something. It took us long enough to get to Mars, but 2080 was better than nothing. \"Roger that John, you're a go\" I climbed down the stairs and hovered my foot over the soil as I prepared an impromptu speech. \"Eh. I can't think of anything.\" I nonchalantly shrugged as I stepped onto Mars. \"Fear not, people of Mars. We bring capitalism and taxes, and chocolate among other things.\" Johnson scoffed from the lander door. \"Cut the crap Steve, and bring the flag down.\" I said. We planted the flag and played the same stunts as the Apollo missions did on the moon. Collecting samples and what not. \"Did Huston ever acknowledge our last status update Kelly?\" I asked somewhat worried. \"No boss. It's been a half hour\" she replied. Suddenly Johnson's voice sprang from the lander. \"Hey chief, looks like our comms are down. The chips got fried. Must of been on their last legs until just now.\" \"Well shit... We have to Reestablish comms. I suddenly remembered something very important. Something that may effect the very fate of the mission\" I said mysteriously. Johnson and Kelly tried to ask but I brushed them off with \"That's classified\" \"We have to move now fellas. We can Reestablish a link with that old rover we sent decades ago. Currys? Quirie... Something..\" \"Curiosity Commander..?\" Kelly offered. \"Yes I suppose that's the motivation for sending a rover in the first place. But enough of that. Let's go.\" \"Our lander's tracking grid puts it a good 15 miles from here. Let's get cracking.\" I said \"Are you sure this will work?\" Johnson asked. \"Of course it will! Besides, I told you I have an urgent message for Houston!\" And so the journey began. We hiked for miles over rugged Martian terrain. As we were crossing a craggy opening in a ridge, Johnson tripped and twisted his ankle badly. \"Ohhhhh! Holy shit!\" He exclaimed. \"Come on man. Walk it off!\" I encouraged. \"Commander, he almost broke his ankle. I don't think he can keep going...\" Kelly observed. \"Oh well. We'll come back for him. Come on.\" \"Are you serious?!\" They both exclaimed at once. \"Dead serious. Pun not intended. Let me make this clear. My message for Houston is worth as much as any one of our lives.\" \"Fine. I suppose it's for the good of the mission but please hurry\" Johnson plead. \"No worries brother. We'll be back soon.\" I comforted. Kelly and I trudged on. A thick sandstorm erupted for ten minutes but we forged ahead, stopping at the top of a ridge as the storm died. \"There's the rover!\" It was situated on an outcropping of cliff. There was a 7 foot gap between its cliff and ours, with a 100 ft drop between. I looked at Kelly. \"We have to jump. You go first and make sure the ground is stable over there.\" She dropped her jaw and gasped at me. \"Well?,\" I said. \"Go on\" She rolled her eyes and took a running start before jumping across. She caught the ledge with her hands and the rock gave way. She fell ten feet to a lower cliff. \"Too bad\" I sighed. \" She'll have a memorial in DC for this.\" \"I'm still alive Jackwad!\" Her scream echoed through the head set. \"Oh excellent!\" I jumped to her cliff which was much easier to get too. \"Let me climb onto your shoulders and climb up there.\" \"Fine...\" She sighed. She let out girlish squeaks of pain and discomfort as Martian rocks and my boots hit her helmet. I pulled her up and we walked over to the rover. \"Dusty but solar power is solar power!\" I said. After several minutes of tinkering, the rover powered up and squirted grease all over Kelly. \"Hahaha. That's excellent\" I chortled. She pushed me and huffed. I hooked a small wrist pad into the rover for video chat and made Kelly stand ontop of the rover moving the antenna left and right like an old tv. \"Houston...hello? Anybody home?\" After several attempts, a middle aged nerd with a NASA pocket protector popped on screen with many others like him in the background behind consoles and computers. A roar of excitement and cheer ran through the room. \"This is Houston. We're glad to have you back John! We thought something terrible had happened! How goes the mission? Have you collected soil samples?!\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yeah yeah. Rocks-and-what-not, not-important. I have a very important request. Over. I said loudly and deliberately. \"Sure go ahead. Over\" \"Please send someone to my house to turn off my stove.\" At this Houston tried to respond. \"Sure. Will do. But did you...\" I cut them off. \"Commander Thorton Out\" I clicked the screen off and leaned back against the rover, arms crossed and grinning with satisfaction. Kelly became red. \"WHAT. WE ALMOST DIED...FOR THAT?!\" I smacked my lips twice slowly. \"Yep\"", "rewritten_text": "\"Are you ready, Commander?\" Kelly asked with her usual upbeat tone. \"Always ready, Lieutenant,\" I answered stoically. I took a quick glance over at Johnson and nodded. He slammed a button on the lander wall, and the staircased door hydraulically lowered to the Martian surface. \"We are making history today, fellas,\" I offered to my crew. \"Houston, this is Commander Thorton. We are ready to step off. Do we have the green light?\" The radio signal beamed from my helmet to the Martian lander, then sprang up to a communications satellite, which transformed it into near spread of light plasma pulses relayed to Earth. Technology was truly remarkable. It had taken us long enough to get to Mars, but 2080 was better than nothing.\n\n\"Roger that, John. You're a go.\" I climbed down the stairs and hovered my foot over the soil as I prepared an impromptu speech. \"Eh. I can't think of anything,\" I nonchalantly shrugged as I stepped onto Mars. \"Fear not, people of Mars. We bring capitalism, taxes, and chocolate, among other things,\" I said. Johnson scoffed from the lander door. \"Cut the crap, Steve, and bring the flag down.\" We planted the flag and performed similar stunts as the Apollo missions did on the moon, collecting samples and whatnot.\n\n\"Did Houston ever acknowledge our last status update, Kelly?\" I asked somewhat worried. \"No, boss. It's been a half-hour,\" she replied. Suddenly, Johnson's voice sprang from the lander. \"Hey, chief, looks like our comms are down. The chips got fried. Must have been on their last legs until just now.\" \"Well, we have to reestablish comms.\" I suddenly remembered something very important, something that may affect the very fate of the mission. \"That's classified,\" I brushed off their inquiries.\n\n\"We have to move now, fellas. We can reestablish a link with that old rover we sent decades ago. Curiosity? Quirie... Something...\" \"Curiosity, Commander...?\" Kelly offered. \"Yes, I suppose that's the motivation for sending a rover in the first place. But enough of that. Let's go.\" \"Our lander's tracking grid puts it a good 15 miles from here. Let's get cracking,\" I said. \"Are you sure this will work?\" Johnson asked. \"Of course, it will! Besides, I told you I have an urgent message for Houston!\" And so the journey began.\n\nWe hiked for miles over rugged Martian terrain. As we crossed a craggy opening in a ridge, Johnson tripped and twisted his ankle badly. \"Ohhhhh! Holy shit!\" He exclaimed. \"Come on, man. Walk it off!\" I encouraged. \"Commander, he almost broke his ankle. I don't think he can keep going,\" Kelly observed. \"Oh well. We'll come back for him. Come on.\" \"Are you serious?!\" They both exclaimed at once. \"Dead serious. Pun not intended. My message for Houston is worth as much as any one of our lives.\" \"Fine. I suppose it's for the good of the mission, but please hurry,\" Johnson pleaded. \"No worries, brother. We'll be back soon,\" I comforted. Kelly and I trudged on.\n\nA thick sandstorm erupted for ten minutes, but we forged ahead, stopping at the top of a ridge as the storm died. \"There's the rover!\" It was situated on an outcropping of a cliff. There was a 7-foot gap between its cliff and ours, with a 100 ft drop between. I looked at Kelly. \"We have to jump. You go first and make sure the ground is stable over there.\" She dropped her jaw and gasped at me. \"Well? Go on.\" She rolled her eyes and took a running start before jumping across. She caught the ledge with her hands, and the rock gave way. She fell ten feet to a lower cliff. \"Too bad,\" I sighed. \"She'll have a memorial in DC for this.\" \"I'm still alive, Jackwad!\" Her scream echoed through the headset. \"Oh, excellent!\" I jumped to her cliff, which was much easier to get to. \"Let me climb onto your shoulders and climb up there.\" \"Fine...\" She sighed. She let out girlish squeaks of pain and discomfort as Martian rocks and my boots hit her helmet. I pulled her up, and we walked over to the rover. \"Dusty but solar power is solar power!\" I said. After several minutes of tinkering, the rover powered up and squirted grease all over Kelly. \"Hahaha. That's excellent,\" I chortled. She pushed me and huffed. I hooked a small wrist pad into the rover for a video chat and made Kelly stand on top of the rover, moving the antenna left and right like an old TV. \"Houston...hello? Anybody home?\" After several attempts, a middle-aged nerd with a NASA pocket protector popped on the screen with many others like him in the background behind consoles and computers. A roar of excitement and cheer ran through the room. \"This is Houston. We're glad to have you back, John! We thought something terrible had happened! How goes the mission? Have you collected soil samples?!\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Rocks and whatnot, not important. I have a very important request. Over.\" I said loudly and deliberately. \"Sure, go ahead. Over.\" \"Please send someone to my house to turn off my stove.\" At this, Houston tried to respond. \"Sure. Will do. But did you...\" I cut them off. \"Commander Thorton Out.\" I clicked the screen off and leaned back against the rover, arms crossed and grinning with satisfaction. Kelly became red. \"WHAT. WE ALMOST DIED...FOR THAT?!\" I smacked my lips twice slowly. \"Yep.\""}, "t1_iucjmqx": {"original_text": "Watching the events unfold on the news last month wasn't a strange thing.

Or rather, that\u2019s my actual name. Everyone who comes by though, knows me as \u201cworried villager\u201d. Every day, we have to recite our lines to whoever decides to come by today and raid our houses for whatever strange objects we might have acquired in our life. After all, they\u2019re the Heroes of Light, that\u2019s definitely enough justification to rob everyone of their belongings. To them, we\u2019re just as faceless as the many monsters they tend to slay on a daily basis, only instead of giving them EXP and having a reason to slaughter them, we\u2019re what they\u2019re trying to protect and give out generally useless trivia whenever they feel like they want to stop for a chat. Repeatedly. But that\u2019s just what they see when it\u2019s their turn. In truth, our job starts after the player leaves. The buzzers go off, everyone breathes a heavy sigh of relief and we can all drop our incredibly fake smiles. Because now it\u2019s time to fix everything they left behind. Everyone, be they a person manning a shop, to important story NPCs, has a job to do once the player leaves. Some people stock the various pots and pans the players raid for items, others reset dungeon hazards, and bosses have until the next player comes on to wake up and get themselves healthy and ready for action. I\u2019m pretty sure that Cornieran princess has to run back to Garland\u2019s keep and pretend to be kidnapped each time, and she doesn\u2019t get help running back. She\u2019s a trooper, that one. While my job may look like a simple townsperson worried about the Lich and his band of demons that razed our town and to beg the heroes to save us, in truth, I have a much different occupation: Monster cleanup. What, did you think monsters just fade from existence when someone stabs them enough? Hell no, even if we want them to think that way. In truth, that\u2019s a lot of dead bodies to clean up, and it\u2019s not exactly a glamourous business, but it\u2019s a job that someone\u2019s gotta do. Not like I chose to do it; we don\u2019t get a choice. If we don\u2019t, it\u2019ll cause strain on the actual game, and as a result, may cause bugs, glitches, or god knows what else. That \u201cPeninsula of Power Leveling\u201d? That was an incident that the last guy never got to fixing before launch. Thankfully the powers that be were able to cover that up, but things like that can\u2019t be a common occurrence, especially on a game that\u2019s already in someone\u2019s home. My daily job, outside of standing around looking like a crazed moron, consists of getting a tally of everything that person killed today, clean up what\u2019s left and make the world presentable for all ages by the time the next person comes to play. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure a field of hundreds of dead goblins won\u2019t really go over well with the 10 year olds who get the game brand new at Blockbuster. Not only that, but we have to restock the monsters. Yeah, those monsters don\u2019t come back. We have to restock them day by day. I\u2019m not sure where they come from, or why they have gold, entire bottles of potion or even sharp pointy objects inside of them, but we never seem to run out. Part of me thinks they run on a job similar to ours, but we\u2019ll never know since they don\u2019t speak Human all too well. If they do, it only makes me appreciate my job that much more; at least I don\u2019t have to throw myself onto a hero\u2019s sword every day. All of this is done so people can enjoy our world, even if it\u2019s at the expense of our own lives. Really, we were made for this purpose so it\u2019s to be expected. That said, watching a player run through our little town of Melmond is always an experience provided they don\u2019t want a conversation and we have to recite our lines and keep our nice, fake smiles on. It\u2019s just what comes after that makes me worry the most. I hope this one didn\u2019t kill any Zombie Dragons. They\u2019re rare but drop good equipment, so some players like to hunt for them for their gear, but they leave a terrible stink when they die and crumble into pieces, making them a pain in the ass to clea- I had to open my big stupid mouth. Entire fields covered in what could only be described as Dragon bones. This one was busy. Very busy. Clearly he had a lot of time on his hands. Well, that\u2019s just the part of the job, might as well sta- The buzzer just went off. The player is at the title screen. He didn\u2019t even leave for 20 minutes before coming back. We have a distinct problem. Panicking, I grabbed the nearest shovel and started throwing everything I could into the river close by. I got it just cleaned, but the river turned a very distinct brown that clearly wasn\u2019t there before. Hopefully the player wouldn\u2019t notice. I rushed back to my designated walking spot in town right before the Player booted in from their last save. He\u2019s looking around, like before he saved, maybe he won\u2019t no- He noticed. He\u2019s definitely noticed. And he\u2019s walking towards me. Crapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrap I\u2019m gonna have to improvise. In my panic, I blurted out, completely off script, \u201cThe Lich not only leveled our town with his demon army, but also poisoned our water supply! You have to help us, brave heroes!\u201d I could feel the holes Rob was glaring into me from across town. I DIDN\u2019T HAVE AN OPTION, ROB. Thankfully, the player seemed to have bought it, and goes about his merry way, probably to go kill Lich again. Since the monsters are connected to him, killing him WILL fix the water supply. So technically I was right? I guess? I\u2019ll take it, it\u2019ll just be another schoolyard rumor like that strange cat thing under the truck. What did they call that? Myew or something? And this is my daily life. Clean up their messes, improvise, try not to be found out, and make the experience as enjoyable as possible for the player. Oh and try not to pass out from the smell. I\u2019m pretty sure that river smells like cockatrice dung now. _________________________________________________________________ Some people might notice the FF1 influence I had when writing.

Though my unscripted plea raises eyebrows, it serves its purpose, allowing the player to rectify the situation by defeating the Lich once more.\n\nThus, my daily routine involves rectifying player-induced chaos, thinking on my feet, and ensuring a seamless gaming experience, all while enduring the pungent aftermath of my cleanup efforts."}, "t1_gqu2ihn": {"original_text": "Madog\u2019s silver dented helm glistened against the setting sun and the luscious open green field, a \u201ccrack\u201d, \u201cslice\u201d and blood sprayed across the helm as he looked off across the field.

The door creaked open and Madog stepped through, shorter than Dondan, taller than the guards' men, wearing silver chain mail, gauntlets and sabatons under his rags which were held together with a silver belt, his broad spatha sitting in its scabbard on his hip. \u201cNormally, Holy Knights take off their helms when entering the king's castle, out of respect, deadman,\u201d spat Dondan. \u201cFuckin\u2019 freak\u201d, pot belly cursed at him, spiting at the wood floor. Madog lifted his head and took notice of the gold morning star held up by a crescent moon emblem that sat on the chest of Dondans pristine armour. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t\u201d Madog answered, his gravelly voice muffled from his helm was calm and collected, \u201cI need no assistance, I know where the Priest is\u201d. Madog walked past the hulking giant Dondan, all three of the men noticing a large something on his back, horns protruding through the thin light brown rag tied to his back, dripping something dark onto the floor. Once Madog had left, the rat-faced leaned closer to his friend, \u201cthey call him Mad-dog The Butcher\u201d, he whispered, scared The Holy Knight might somehow hear him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard they cahn crush ah booars skull with their bahre hahnds,\u201d also whispering. \u201cMadog!

Come iiiin!\u201d he announced, leaving the door open for Madog, who stood at the entrance. Entering the dimly lit room, with shelves and shelves full of books filling the walls of the room, the table was full of jars, scrolls, leaves, petals and small bones. Madog began to untie the knot holding the rag on his back and let it drop upon the floor. Grabbing a horn and pulling it around, he slammed it on the table. \u201cA Drekkun head, horns, teeth and skull, kept intact, how much?\u201d Madog demanded the Priest. The Drekkun head bled a dark reddish grey onto the desk, the horns curled thrice, face frozen in a menacing animalistic snarl. Four top and bottom front teeth interlocking with each other sat in full view, sharper than a razor. Nose like a bear and beady little grey eyes filled out the rest of its face. \u201cHmm\u201d the Priest said, unamused at what he studied before him, \u201chundred\u201d. \u201cOne hundred Black Gold?\u201d \u201cNoo, one hundred Red Silver,\u201d the Priest snidely corrected Madog \u201cOne measly Black Gold! The head is pristine, even the eyes are. Why so little Gruden!\u201d Madog shouted. \u201cLook Madog, the market isn\u2019t doing too well right now, monsters aren\u2019t really what people want and sorcerers want something a bit rarer than a Drekkun these days, I\u2019m being fair here,\u201d Gruden told him honestly. Madog sighed heavily, \u201cfine, have it your way, here\u2019s seventy Red Silvers for the hide and meat as well\u201d, he snapped as he threw the money at Gruden, clattering across the room and shuddering as the coins hit the wood floor. \u201cRemember who you\u2019re speaking to, I revived you, you owe me! I can just as easily put you back in the grave, one Gold and seventy Silver, pathetic,\u201d he growled, \u201cyou\u2019re never going to pay me back the seven-thousand Gold are you?\u201d. \u201cJust give me another job, you have more jobs, don\u2019t you?\u201d Madog reluctantly asked. \u201cOf course, what kind of Priest do you take me for?\u201d \u201cGive me one you know is going to pay me the most then\u201d. \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for that, just yet. You'd be facing a Wailing Druid, you will die,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cJust give me the location and the tools needed and I\u2019ll do the rest,\u201d Madog shot back as he left, \u201cI\u2019ll be in my quarters!\u201d He called from the hallway. \u201cMad-dog The Butcher, you will die, you fool, they'll call you Mad-dog The Dead!\u201d Gruden shouted back.

A crack, a slice, and blood sprayed across the helm as he gazed out across the field. From the other side of an enormous wooden doorway came a series of loud bangs. Two men, clad in chain mail, one with a rat-like face and a burned cheek, the other potbellied and unwashed, wearing conical helmets, exchanged amused glances.\n\n\"What time do you call this, eh?\" the rat-faced man with the burned cheek inquired. \"Probably those peasants again,\" the potbellied man replied, \"not opening it, they could freeze,\" he chuckled. The rat-faced man cackled, masking the clanking sound approaching them. Suddenly, a figure clad in Knights armor towered above them, causing the two men to straighten up in respectful fear.\n\n\"Dondan, we-we didn't hear you coming, sir,\" stammered the rat-faced man. \"There's someone at the door, sire,\" he added nervously. \"Why do you think I'm here? When do I ever voluntarily come here to talk to you mugs?\" Dondan retorted, his white and gold encrusted armor reflecting the torchlight beautifully. With disdain for the guards evident on his scarred face, Dondan held his flat-top helm under his arm, his hand resting on the hilt of his claymore.\n\n\"Well then, open it!\" Dondan commanded, prompting the guards to quickly lift the wooden bar and open the door. Madog entered, shorter than Dondan but taller than the guards, wearing silver chain mail, gauntlets, and sabatons under his ragged attire held together by a silver belt. Dondan, noticing Madog's helm still on, spat, \"Normally, Holy Knights remove their helms when entering the king's castle, out of respect, deadman.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Madog replied calmly, his gravelly voice muffled by the helm. \"I need no assistance; I know where the Priest is.\" As Madog passed by Dondan, the guards noticed something large on his back, horns protruding through a rag and dripping something dark onto the floor.\n\nOnce Madog had left, the rat-faced guard leaned closer to his companion, whispering, \"They call him Mad-dog The Butcher.\" \"I've heard they can crush a boar's skull with their bare hands,\" the potbellied guard whispered back.\n\n\"Madog! Good to see you, dear friend,\" the sniveling Priest greeted cheerfully, wearing slightly oversized blue and white silk robes. \"Come in, come in!\" he beckoned, leaving the door open for Madog, who stood at the entrance. Inside the dimly lit room filled with shelves of books, jars, scrolls, leaves, petals, and bones, Madog untied the knot holding the rag on his back and let it fall to the floor. Placing a horn on the table, he demanded, \"A Drekkun head, horns, teeth, and skull, intact. How much?\"\n\nThe Priest, unamused, replied, \"One hundred Red Silvers.\" Madog protested, \"One hundred Black Gold for this pristine head? Even the eyes are intact!\" After a brief negotiation, Madog reluctantly paid seventy Red Silvers for the hide and meat as well.\n\nAs Madog left, he asked for another job, to which the Priest hesitated, warning him of the dangers. Undeterred, Madog insisted on the location and tools needed, declaring he would handle the task. With a final warning from the Priest, Madog left for his quarters, leaving behind a tense atmosphere and a foreboding prophecy."}, "t1_fitbvcb": {"original_text": "To try and figure out the math behind it was not unlike putting folk song to sheet music. It was never really about the steps, position of her feet, the geometry of swirling limbs. It was emotion that rained from her raw and unbidden. She didn't know that, and was caught in the web of trying to effect an outcome with precision. Her faithful, a choir of kneeling zealots creating the violent music behind which she'd bound and leap across a floor stitched with runes. They howled and drummed, flailing with emotion as she effected her dance. Mary Anne had trained for years, a prodigal daughter. She brought a driving rain the first time she stepped upon the runic floor to the delight of the faithful. To deal in fate, however, is to take on a debt. As she danced, one day, bright and clear, she leaped. High, smooth her stride was, but her foot was off by a matter of degrees. It slid on the glass-smooth bamboo planks and there was a rending. A crack, a gasp, sudden pain and she was falling, falling into the concentric rings etched beneath her. Her hands where flung behind her in an expression of joyous exuberance. She was pinioned by the design of her movement and as her supple ankle gave she slammed head first against the floor. Suddenly, all the faithful went silent. Sixty-four miles up a stony peak the faithful did what they could. A concussion, an orbital fracture, torn ligaments in her ankle that without modern medicine never set right. It didn't matter, as her primitive care led to deep infection. Dancing, dancing day and night her mother was desperate for something, anything to alter the stream of fate. To save that which was most precious to her. Save she did, but at the end her daughter was slim, sickly, and her fore leg ended in a cruel bloody stump. At fist she wanted nothing to do with the rites, she forsake them as a past never attainable again. Her father came, and taught her the ways of the world beneath the tree line of their mountain. The delicacies of language, the ordained steps of history, the meter of science and the rune-law of math. She thought she might descend and forget the things she'd seen and done before the crowd of faithful. But the power and it's lure was undeniable, and now things that her mother's single-minded focus had missed where laid bare. She could make numbers dance as efficiently as her body, more so. Down the slope she did go, one day, her purpose and calling coming clear. &#x200B; \"If we can't keep these Lockheed-Martin contacts we might lose Colorado. That union endorsement is the only thing holding their voting majority together. It's expensive war-profiteering garbage, I know, but it's a one-point-six million dollar seal on congressional majority going into the midterms next year. I don't think we can do without it, I understand the position it puts you...Are you with us, Madame?\" She had closed her eyes, but for a moment, and was rubbing her temples. The 2022 budget was splayed out before her- four easels with poster boards covered in tiny strips of ever-flowing numbers. Papers were shotgunned across the resolute desk, almost completely covering it's history-stained surface. She went methodically, eyes flitting from form to form, value to value. Her aides, the treasury secretary, chief of her staff and the budget czars watched her expectantly, hungrily. She picked up a sheet, that tried to predict the laminar flow of skilled workers through states as jobs were subsidized. She held it along side a grainy map of western state voting districts and their overlapping blocks. She put them down and fixed the uppity secretary with a withering stare. \"Regardless of whether those contracts are removed, those unions aren't going anywhere, not until the promised warplanes are airborne, at any rate. Congressman Deacon can find the money in his budget if he needs it, I think another extension is beyond over-building our congressional majority. The Democrats are going to have us on military spending no matter how many chips we drop on these contracts. We can't put our medicare extension into place without this money, because it's not one-six-million, it's eight million over five years. At that point it'll be midterms again and we'll have this same argument and Lockheed will laugh all the way to the bank. The progessive party only has so many years to waffle and water down it's actions. No, lets strip this bandaid off before the glue sets. Are you with me, Sir?\" He shrank visibly, collapsing inwards and pulling back just beyond the threshold of people. They didn't know, how could they? Her mother's faithful never knew what their hammering primal music really meant. They didn't have an understanding of the weft of fate each step entailed. These men where smart, the smartest she'd yet found, but not prescient. Not like her. The Lockheed contracts made sense, seemed like the prefect answer. But no, it would be like her misstep on the rune-clad floor all those years ago. She hadn't trusted herself then, set up an impressive leap instead of tempering her movements in accordance with fate. They plowed ahead together, dancer and faithful, beating at fate's warp to weave the world to their wishes.", "rewritten_text": "Trying to decipher the math behind it was akin to transcribing a folk song onto sheet music. It wasn't about the technicalities\u2014the steps, foot positions, or swirling limbs' geometry. It was the raw, unbidden emotion that poured forth. Unaware of this, she found herself entangled in the pursuit of precision. Her devoted followers, a choir of fervent zealots, created a tumultuous backdrop against which she danced and leaped across a floor inscribed with ancient symbols. They howled and drummed, swept up in emotion as she performed her intricate dance.\n\nMary Anne, a prodigious talent who had trained for years, brought a torrential downpour of emotion the first time she graced the runic floor, much to the delight of her faithful followers. However, delving into matters of fate comes with a price. One fateful day, as she executed a high, graceful leap, a slight misalignment of her foot caused a catastrophic misstep. Sliding on the smooth bamboo planks, she heard a crack, felt a sharp pain, and tumbled headlong into the etched concentric rings below. The once-raucous faithful fell silent as they witnessed her fall.\n\nHigh atop a stony peak, sixty-four miles away, her followers did what they could to aid her. Suffering from a concussion, an orbital fracture, torn ligaments in her ankle, and subsequent infections due to primitive care, Mary Anne's dancing days turned into a desperate struggle for survival. Her mother, in a bid to alter fate and save her daughter, resorted to drastic measures. Despite her efforts, Mary Anne emerged from the ordeal frail, ailing, and missing a limb.\n\nInitially resistant to the rituals she once embraced, Mary Anne distanced herself from her past and sought solace in her father's teachings below the mountain's tree line. Immersing herself in language, history, science, and mathematics, she contemplated leaving behind her previous life among the faithful. Yet, the allure of power proved irresistible, revealing truths overlooked by her mother's single-minded focus. She discovered a newfound ability to manipulate numbers with the same precision as her body, if not more so, leading her down a path where her purpose and calling became clear.\n\n\"If we lose these Lockheed-Martin contracts, we risk losing Colorado. The union endorsement is crucial for maintaining their voting majority, despite the controversial nature of war profiteering. Securing this $1.6 million deal could tip the scales in our favor for the upcoming midterms. I understand the dilemma you face... Are you in agreement, Madame?\" With her eyes closed and temples massaged, she surveyed the 2022 budget sprawled across four easels, covered in a sea of numbers. Papers littered the desk, obscuring its worn surface, as she meticulously analyzed each document.\n\nHer advisors and staff members awaited her decision eagerly. Picking up a sheet predicting the flow of skilled workers through subsidized jobs, she juxtaposed it with a map of voting districts in western states. Fixing a stern gaze on the secretary, she asserted, \"Even without these contracts, the unions will remain steadfast until the warplanes are operational. Congressman Deacon can reallocate funds if necessary; extending the contracts risks jeopardizing our congressional majority. The Democrats will scrutinize our military spending regardless of these deals. We need this funding for our Medicare extension, which amounts to $8 million over five years. Let's not delay the inevitable; we must act decisively before Lockheed profits at our expense. Do you stand with me, Sir?\"\n\nAs her advisor visibly recoiled, retreating from the group, she pondered their lack of foresight. Unlike her mother's faithful followers, these men were intelligent but lacked the insight into the intricate tapestry of fate woven with each decision. While the Lockheed contracts seemed like a logical solution, she recognized the parallels with her past misstep on the rune-covered floor. Back then, she had failed to trust her instincts, opting for a grand leap instead of aligning her movements with destiny. Together, they pressed forward, dancer and followers, challenging fate's design to shape their world according to their desires."}, "t1_cp4d8kq": {"original_text": "Wrote this on my mobile.

She could hear her squad-mates, spread throughout the facility, shouting for her to see reason. They didn't seem to properly understand what they were demanding from her. She stopped a moment and crouched down in the shadows and listened. Several heavy footsteps closing in from all around, someone was running along the catwalks... Probably Rourke or Emmerick, the snipers. She crept up to a corner and peered around it. She could see the silhouette of Danis, carefully sweeping through the darkness with his flashlight off. Adelaide fired a few bursts at him. \"Stay back, Danis!\" She commanded. \"I will kill you if you come any closer!\" \"Dammit Adelaide, would you get a grip!\" Danis shouted back. The heavy footsteps had softened. Her squad was attempting to surround her. She broke out of cover and made for a hardened building. It had survived the heavy bombing in the start of the war, but the years of neglect had taken it's toll. She had to duck under a collapsed beam to get inside, and as she did so she tossed a pair of flashbangs behind her. She followed the corridor for a few hundred metres, and eventually found herself in a giant underground dry-dock. She took a couple of steps in, then suddenly heard a loud crash to her left. She ran up to where the noise came from and found Sam struggling to stand in a giant puddle of old lubricant that was leaking from several drums that had smashed on the concrete. \"Stop Sam!\" Adelaide shrieked, trying to keep her emotion out of her voice. \"Stop running!\" Sam sighed and settled on his knees. They stayed in silence for almost a minute, before Sam looked up at Adelaide and began to weep. \"I don't want to go.\" He said. \"I only just met you, I don't want to go!\" \"Stop!\" Adelaide cried. She lifted her battle-rifle and aimed at Sam. \"I don't want this, but it's the only way! You said so, yourself!\" \"No!\" Sam pleaded. \" There's another way, there has to be! Maybe we don't need him!\" Adelaide wiped a tear from her eye without dropping her aim. She cursed the universe and everything in it for putting her in this situation. There was a sudden crash, and Adelaide spun around to see Rourke and Emmerick fast roping onto the catwalks high above from a busted ventilation shaft, while Danis and Skye breached through a wall on the ground floor beneath them. Adelaide grabbed Sam and pulled him out of the lubricant. Under distracting gunfire, she led him through the rusted wreckage of a half built Destroyer, lying in pieces across the dock. As they weaved through the debris, she caught a clear line of sight to Emmerick, who was scanning the room for her. She pulled out her pistol and fired three shots, hitting his leg. She proceeded to fire a few more shots at Danis and Skye, while Sam retreated further into the dock. Gradually, Adelaide was pushed back until the only place left to go was into the ocean. She took cover with Sam behind a giant chunk of broken sea wall, knee deep in the water and checked her remaining ammo. They both knew this was the end of the line for Sam. \"Give it up, Adelaide.\" Danis shouted. There was a hint of sorrow in his voice, and Adelaide remembered that he was Sam's friend, too. \"Please... Let's just... Get this over with...\" Sam stood up and walked out of cover. He wanted to say something, but he couldn't find the words. He met eyes with Danis and began to cry, which made Adelaide cry. For the first time since 'the fracture', Adelaide let her emotions beat her. \"We need him, Sam...\" Danis finally said. \"He's the only one that can destroy her... For good...\" Sam, still unable to talk simply nodded, and fell to his knees. \"Wait!\" Adelaide shouted just as Danis was preparing to shoot. Skye and Rourke lined her up in their sights. Adelaide stared them down, unintimidated. \"... I'll do it.\" She knelt down before Sam and rested her forehead on his. \"I wish...\" She sobbed. \"I wish things were different...\" \"I don't\" Sam replied softly. \"If things were different... If 'He' wasn't inside me... We'd never have held off the hoard in India... Never have broken the siege of Seoul... Never been caught in the panic at Okinawa... You'd never have been sent to rescue me... We'd never have met\" He felt Adelaide put her arms around him, and their lips met. Davis and Skye averted their gaze. \"This is the only way.\" Sam whispered. \"I know...\" Adelaide replied. \"... I love you.\" A single shot echoed through the underground dock. Adelaide felt Sam go limp, dropped her pistol, and lowered him gently sideways into the shallow water, and allowed herself to weep. After a few minutes had passed, she felt Sam's body stir. She stood up and waited. Then Sam's body stood up beside her. \"You had better be all that humanity hopes you to be, and then some you piece of shit.\" She whispered.", "rewritten_text": "Written on my mobile, please excuse any formatting errors.

He was on a journey of self development. Tim was working his way out of an addiction to his phone. He looked at his phone for more of his day than he would look at the world around him. He would constantly check all of his social media apps, and waste his day going through random videos online. On top of that, all that constant checking made him a very anxious person, which led him to drink way too much coffee, which led to stay up all night. But he recognized his addiction, and decided to do something about it. He thoughtfully came to the realization that all his problems stemmed from having constant access to the internet. That's when he began a transformation. He started to go away from the city on meditation retreats. He would go on spontaneous weekend getaways without his phone or laptop, and be forced to live without internet. This time his getaway was to a forest that was famously known in the spiritual community, because people would go there for deep meditation retreats and experience transformation. Tim's journey to disconnect from the internet had been especially tough recently, he really wanted this! Maybe this was the last piece he needed to get rid of his phone addiction for good! His backpack held all his survival essentials. The only reason he had his phone on him was to listen to meditation tapes the first night of the retreat to help him get into the groove of it.

It was just 1 bar, which would disappear every few seconds, which made Tim assume the phone was accidentally mistaking something for a signal. He held it up to the sky and two bars appeared. He walked forward, and saw a third bar flickering. He recklessly ran forward, internally freaking out while staring at the Wifi bars on his phone. \u201cFour! How do I have four freaking bars!

However, throughout all of this, she had her eyes trained on a pair of bright blue orbs, desperately chasing behind them. He was running after her, arms and legs scrambling to make up the distance.

He appeared to be around nine or ten years old, with thick-rimmed square glasses perched awkwardly on his nose as he frantically wiped at his eyes. He was determined not to cry in front of her. \"Are you really...?\" Beside him sat a girl in a simple hospital gown, buried under a pile of blankets. She was also young, about his age, with locks of hair swept to the side and tears welling in her green eyes as she gazed at him. \"Come on, Charlie... don\u2019t cry. Mommy said boys don\u2019t cry.\" Charlie shook his head vigorously. \"I\u2019m not crying!\" A hiccuping sob betrayed his words, but neither of them acknowledged it. \"But are you really...\" He couldn\u2019t bring himself to finish the sentence, to believe it. Instead, he wrapped his arms around the girl\u2019s smaller frame, clinging to her as if today might be the last time he ever saw her. \"Please don\u2019t go. I don\u2019t want you to go, Em. Please.\" His words were whispered, instantly bringing fresh tears to both their eyes. A moment stretched into eternity as they held each other, trembling in the face of news they didn\u2019t want to accept. Two best friends, inseparable since birth. From sharing baby cribs to sunny days and an innocent crush that would leave a lasting mark on their hearts. Charlie never wanted this moment to end. \"Charchar,\" Emily breathed softly, seemingly the calmer of the two, having already come to terms with her fate. \"Mommy\u2019s calling me. I have to go now.\" \"No!\" Charlie\u2019s defiant yell didn\u2019t surprise her; he had always been stubborn. \"Come on, Charchar,\" she coaxed. \"It\u2019ll be like that time at the park again. When we explored the creek, remember?\" \"No! I\u2019m not letting you go. You can\u2019t go!\" \"Charchar...\" Tears stung her eyes as she wiped them. With a heart heavy with a million emotions, she continued, \"Come on, Charchar, Mommy\u2019s going to be here any minute.\" \"Em...\" He was now sobbing, tears streaming down his cheeks as he buried his face in her hair, holding on desperately. He couldn\u2019t believe it, he refused to believe it. \"No, please no...\" \"Remember when you thought balloons could make you fly?\" A trembling nod. \"Well, Mommy said I\u2019m going to a place where balloons can make us fly.\" Charlie paused, still not letting go. \"But you\u2019re going without me...\" His voice was soft and broken, a tone unfit for a ten-year-old. He should have been outside, playing in the fields and climbing trees with Emily by his side. Not here, never here! He despised this place, the nurses, and this cruel world that was taking her away from him. He despised everything! \"Only for now, Dumdum. Mommy said you can join me in the future.\" A glimmer of hope rose in his chest. \"Really?\" \"Yes, Charchar, I pinky promise.\" His eyes widened. \"P-pinky promise?\" She smiled against his hair. \"Yes!\" \"You can\u2019t break a pinky promise.\" He drew back until their noses almost touched. A watery pair of bright blue eyes met viridian green. \"You know that, right?\" \"Of course I do, Charchar.\" Charlie wrapped his finger around hers, a tradition dating back to their first meeting.

My father was a police officer and my mother was a nurse, and they loved me and cared for me as much as they could, even with their advanced age. We lived in the static of domestic bliss until one day, shortly after my birthday, I was cleaning up from dinner when I heard a sharp knock on the door. My father opened it and let in a young man dressed in a blue uniform, a man who said he was a colleague. Their tones were friendly, then became business like until I heard my father's grow suspicious. By the time I had heard the first gunshot, it was too late to stop the second one, and I rushed to the family room to find my parents slumped over our glass coffee table with the impostor standing wildly surrounded by the shattered remains of our China tea set. Grey hairs grew from his wrinkling skin as he turned to me. \"You're not an immortal yet, you wouldn't understand.\" I was speechless, unable to think, even to breathe. The intruder took steps towards me, the blue uniform looking more unnatural as it sagged on his aging limbs. \"You will understand.\" He said, wrapping his hands around my throat. When I came to, I was tied up in what appeared to be my basement. In the dark I could just make out the hunched over shape of the man as he prepared something out of my sight. He almost immediately noticed I was awake. \"It's a shame to do this to such a pretty young girl.\" He said, clucking his tongue. Once he turned to me, I could see the tubing set up for a blood draw, something my mom had shown me a thousand times before. The brief flash of memory for her lifeless body made me want to scream, but I was bound and had a rag in my mouth which muffled my grief. He removed the insert himself and put it straight into another vial. \"The secret to immortality,\" He said, \"this syringe would have started wars a thousand years ago. Such a shame to use it for such evil, but isn't it refreshingly human to pervert nature?\" The needle tip pierced my skin, which I saw grow leathery and tough as the serum and his blood mixed with mine. The hairs in his nose receded, and his eyes were no longer sunken. He looked the same as how I'd seen him when he'd first strode through the door. The few hairs that had fallen in front of my face grew gray, and I felt the deep urge to cry before everything faded to black. I had to hand it to him, it was a pretty devious crime, killing the parents and leaving behind the mortal child to live forever and take the blame. But he hadn't accounted for one thing. My parents raised me to be a fighter, to be ruthless and cunning in my pursuit of justice. When I came to, I took no time to collect my belongings and burn the place to the ground. I'd take an eternity of harassment by the cops over trying to explain what happened with crows feet behind my eyes. I began wandering, now unburdened by a need for food or shelter, looking for the man who killed my parents. I avoided judging stares or helpful strangers, but never young police officers or new families. I kept my eye on them. There are plenty of killers that have found the same trick, and even as I grow weaker and slower, it gets easier to trap them and remove them from the equation of life.

Billions of deaths later you realize the truth: Every single person in all history is your past or future incarnations.\u201d I looked down at the parchment, frozen. The quill perched between my thumb and forefinger was suspended inanimately above my inkwell, remnants from the last dunk sliding down the point onto the oaken surface of my table. They trickled down, down, down, coagulating into a miniature puddle of black; a black that reflected the dark look held on my face. I forget exactly what my expression was at the time, yet I do remember the raucous swirl of emotion it beheld: A mixture of confusion, contempt, and a tinge of twisted pride. One was paramount above the others, though: Fear. A bead of sweat dripped down my forehead as I studied the meaning of the words I\u2019d written upon the parchment. I wanted to look away, yet I couldn\u2019t; Transfixed by the paragraph, my body betrayed me, forcing me to read. Reading it on loop, it first seemed like a jumbled mass of nonsense; The nonsense of what I\u2019d written while absentminded for the most miniscule moment. Though I stoutly attempted to reassure myself that it was such, I couldn\u2019t find it within me to dismiss it. Something about it gripped me and wouldn\u2019t release, as if I were looking directly into a work of art that beheld some sort of hidden meaning about it. Yet the art I\u2019ve seen does not usually inspire fear. Anguish, sure. Dread, perhaps. But nothing explained why this simple paragraph held me so, why I felt a creeping terror invade my mind and body. It was nonsense. When I read it again, nonsense. The next few times, nonsense. I kept rereading it for minutes on end, always coming back to my original conclusion; Though once, just once, it came across as something different: It was nonsense still, yet somehow, had the smallest sliver of truth within it. Upon realizing this, I somehow managed to gain back control of my body. Brutally slamming the parchment down into the table, I violently rose from my seat as the harshness of the motion knocked over my inkwell. The ink within ran, flowing down onto my shirt, yet I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to care. That dreadful feeling from before remained, causing my breaths to become shaky and labored as if I were working in the mines. I stood there, unmoving, my thoughts still obstructed -- as if my flow of reason were gone, as if my emotion overtook my mind, I failed to achieve any level of cool-headedness that coincided with the demeanor of my usual visage. One moment, I was still. My study, though messy, was silent. The next, I was staring at some sort of illuminated screen. It shone a bright white, yet had bars on the top and bottom that were multicolored, though predominantly black. Again I couldn\u2019t move, forced still by an oppressive overbearance that only allowed me to glimpse my environment. In my peripherals, I could see a board, yet it was one I hadn\u2019t seen before. It had a vast array of nubs and buttons, consisting mostly of squares and rectangles. All were imprinted with a symbol, which I somehow recognized as the English alphabet. Against my will, my fingers moved, pressing down on the buttons with an easy lightness, causing different words to appear on the screen as they swiftly swept across the board with an erratic cadence. With each press, the board lit up momentarily, a teal-ish glow rippling outwards from where my finger had pressed. Looking up from the board, I saw on the formerly blank screen small words, each neatly printed and dyed black. The words were strung into sentences, which were arranged into blocky paragraphs -- paragraphs that reminded me much of my own writing. I -- whoever \u201cI\u201d was -- was writing. For a brief period, the fear was all gone. I was drawn into the words appearing on the screen, focused intently on the small snippets of black speedily amassing across the white. Occasionally, \u201cI\u201d would shift my right hand to a device, rolling my finger across a miniature grooved wheel upon the top. The screen would shift with the action, panning the display upwards to reveal the first few scripts and pages of writing. Things would pause as I studied the words, but the writing would always resume as the first press of a button instantly scrolled all the way down to the empty white of unwritten sentences. The prior fear had vanished entirely as I observed the steady ebb and flow of words appearing and disappearing before me, sentences surging forth and receding with unprecedented, chaotic tempo. Though the tempo had a discordant rhythm to it. One familiar to me: The rhythm of writing. Soon, the hands on the keyboard lay still. Completely mesmerized, I eagerly awaited to see what \u201cI\u201d would write next upon the screen. Nothing appeared, though. Minutes passed, and nothing new came up. I saw a finger apprehensively approach a button, but recoil away slightly. It reached out towards the key once more, yet stopped within a millimeter\u2019s length away from pressing it. It stood there, frozen, for what seemed like hours on end. Finally, with what seemed to be a herculean effort backing it, the key was pressed. And at once, I returned to my study. The oil lamp still remained bright, as if no time had passed at all. The crumpled remains of drafts and wasted parchment lay scattered across the floor, overturned books accompanying them frequently. There was no shaking present in my arms, no quivering in my legs, no harsh breaths; in fact, all of that was gone. Completely gone with no trace of their appearance in the first place, aside from my own memory. \u201cWhat,\u201d I uttered, \u201cWas that?\u201d", "rewritten_text": "As an amateur writer, I present Part 1 of a story: \"Whenever you die, you can reincarnate at any point in history with full memories of your past lives.

I watched as sentences flowed across the screen with an erratic rhythm, reminiscent of the act of writing.

Hours later, once it was quiet again and my parents had gone to sleep, exhausted after the adrenaline had worn away I crept from my room. Most of the debris was cleared away and there were tarps over the damaged portions but I wasn\u2019t interested in what the car had done, I wanted to go back down to the basement.

Dave-From-Work had talked him into going for an after work walk to the hot dog guy that was always set up a little ways into Central Park. He normally avoided the area but his cubicle mate had been going on for days about a dog with fried onions and he was pretty sure nothing at home was a better option. He\u2019d almost made it out too. They\u2019d already eaten and were on their way back to the car park to go home, almost out of the park when it happened. A strange woman had bumped into him, grabbing onto his forearm with a grip that was startling coming from her small stature. He had moved to apologize and pull away but the next thing he knew, she had whipped him round and dipped him like he was on a dance floor instead of in a bougie mid-city park. After that it was just a blur. They spun and twirled while Dave marveled and clapped along until she released him with a flourish, and when he steadied himself and turned to look for her she was gone. Thankfully the next thing he touched was his umbrella on the ground and not a human or animal because the moment his fingers closed around it, it crumpled like it was made of tissue paper. He had stared at the umbrella for a good ten minutes before folding the rest of it into a neat ball with his bare hands and tossing it in a near by garbage can while Dave stared openly. He had gone straight home and started (gently) googling what the fuck was going on with him. While the academic sources were less than helpful, he had found a treasure trove of information in the form of an obscure fan-subbed South-Colombian cartoon, which according to Google Translate was called \u2018Dance Away Death\u2019. While he couldn\u2019t quite remember the steps the woman in Central Park had pulled him in to, it seemed similar to the penultimate climax of the mid-season cliffhanger when the hero, named either Lord Tango or Lord Lazy (Google Translate was indecisive), did a complicated 60 second routine to summon an ancient golem which infused him with the strength to defeat the evil Dark Master (who was a 7 foot tall, green Amazonian woman with four arms, a bit cliche but terrifying in its own way). After practicing a bit over the next few weeks, that did indeed seem to be how it worked. He would do a dance and get super human strength. It wasn\u2019t the most manly super power but it was what he had. The only saving grace was that whoever he chose somehow seemed to automatically know the choreography as long as he led. It made no sense but he didn\u2019t question it; it was hard to find a solid dance partner these days let alone one with a schedule open enough to drop everything just to do a one minute routine so he could go save the world. It really would have been much handier if he could have had a solo number, like Sailor Moon, or maybe even just a nice shout-out with a badass sword like He-Man. But no, he had to do some souped up version of the Macarena in order to get his super powers, which thankfully were not also dance themed. That would have been too much really.

While the academic sources were unhelpful, he stumbled upon a wealth of information in the form of an obscure fan-subbed South-Colombian cartoon, translated by Google as 'Dance Away Death'. Although he couldn't quite recall the steps the woman in Central Park had led him through, it seemed reminiscent of the climactic scene in the mid-season cliffhanger where the hero, known as either Lord Tango or Lord Lazy (Google Translate was undecided), performed a complex 60-second routine to summon an ancient golem that bestowed him with the strength to defeat the evil Dark Master (a 7-foot-tall, green Amazonian woman with four arms, a bit clich\u00e9 but terrifying in its own right). After practicing for a few weeks, it appeared to work as described. He would dance and gain superhuman strength. It might not have been the most conventional superpower, but it was his. The only silver lining was that whoever he chose as a partner somehow knew the choreography automatically as long as he led. It defied logic, but he didn't question it; finding a reliable dance partner these days was challenging, let alone one with a flexible schedule willing to drop everything for a one-minute routine so he could save the world. It would have been more convenient if he could have had a solo act, like Sailor Moon, or perhaps a powerful sword like He-Man. Instead, he had to perform an enhanced version of the Macarena to activate his superpowers, which thankfully were not dance-themed as well. That would have been too much. He appreciated the power of dance, but there was a limit."}, "t1_cqif6jq": {"original_text": "\"Jenna?\" I heard. I stopped writing in my notebook and got up. \"Jennnnnnnaaaaaa--\" \"I'm right here, jeez.\" I complain, hurrying out into the living room. My roommate, Lisa, grinned brightly at me. She was covered in grime-- no surprise, considering our jobs-- and holding up two pristine white cards. \"You won't believe what I won today!\" \"Rent money?\" \"Better!\" \"I honestly can't think of anything better than rent money.\" \"Then you're not trying!\" Lisa pouted. \"You remember the lottery at your job a month ago?\" I frowned. \"I don't remember anything that happened a month ago. Well, I guess we paid rent a month ago, but--\" \"Stop thinking about rent! I'm talking about the Another Me program!\" \"...\" I thought hard. Another Me had sponsored something at my job, I recalled that much. \"...I do remember something like that.\" Lisa grinned. \" They sponsored my job too and-- Look! I won the cards!\" \"Oh. To do what?\" \"To visit our alternate universe selves!\" She cried, seeming fed up with me. \"Ah. And this isn't all smoke and mirrors? Like that Total Recall place about... ten or so years ago? It's not like that right? Where it's all complete bull?\" \"Didn't Total Recall work too well?\" \"I don't know, I just remember it had to be shut down.\" \"Jenna. Do you NOT want the card? I could give it to someone else. Steve. Leeanna.\" \"I do want it.\" I said, hurriedly. \"I'm just skeptical, that's all. I can't ask questions?\" \"...Well, don't ask ME questions.\" Lisa said, putting the cards on the side table. \"I'm gonna take a shower. We can redeem the cards when you get off of work tomorrow.\" \"You don't have work?\" \"No, I do. But I took the day off because I wanted to do this thing!\" Lisa said, hurring to the bathroom before I got a word in edgewise. I waited for her to turn on the water before I picked up one of the cards. It was thin and light. When tilted, you could read \"Another Me\" in some holographic ink on it. It wasn't a regular card, it was one of the special key cards that required imprinting to be fully read. Lisa had already applied her fingerprint to one, rendering it illegible to me. The other one was pristine and perfect. All I had to do was press my finger into some of the DNA Imprinting ink and press it to the card, and it would show me more information. What information, I wondered, could a place like Another Me need to hide? I had work in two hours... there was no reason to think too hard about it. It was probably just a scheme for rich people to get richer, like some kind of snake oil. I set the card back down and headed back to my room. ______ Work was as grueling as ever. To make us less irritable, they projected a blue sky image onto the ceiling of the facility. It's weird because the sky hasn't been blue for... decades? I've never seen a real blue sky, but I'm sure my parents might've. Steve worked this job with me, and I chatted with him like always. Apparently, Lisa had already told him about her win. \"So Lisa won, did you hear? She said she was going to take you to Another Me!\" Steve shouted over the cauldron's loud noises. \"You guys are lucky! Another Me is really cool!\" \"You've been?\" I shouted back. \"Oh, yeah! Tons of times!\" \"Isn't it kind of expensive?\" \"It is, yeah! But my other self is doing the job I wanted to do, and I just want to know what that's like!\" I pondered this as Steve and I started turning the crank to mix the molten metal in our cauldron. What if my alternate universe me because a chef, like I'd wanted? I wouldn't want to go see them again. Steve was punishing himself by returning. \"Hey, what's the mixture like?\" Steve asked. I checked my screen. \"It looks like we're low on phosphorous,\" I told him. \"I'll put in a request.\" I touched the order button on the screen and we continued mixing. There were about twenty other cauldrons like ours in this area, so I wasn't expecting to get the phosphorous anytime soon. \"Lisa got really lucky,\" Steve shouted again. \"I wish I'd won those tickets!\" I shrugged. If Steve didn't think it was so bad, then maybe it wasn't? ______ Lisa was impatient by the time I got out of the shower. Steve had convinced me that the experience was worth while, but not that it was real. I mean, Steve's dream job was owning ERTHMobile, which is crazy. Steve owning any company other than ERTHMobile made more sense than that. ERTHMobile ran almost every single transportation service off of Earth. For Steve-- who hadn't graduated from college, like myself and Lisa-- to make it there, he must've won at least seven lotteries in that world. \"Hurry up! Have you imprinted on the card yet?\" Lisa complained through the door when I turned off the water. A gust of hot air hit me as the drying cycle began. \"What? Oh, right. Are they open at 5?\" I asked, glancing over at the pristine card sitting on the edge of the sink. \"What? I mean... yeah. No? I don't know!\" \"Check your card!\" I told her. I turned off the drying and stepped out of the shower, picking up a T-shirt I wore to sleep. \"I've got like two hours before they open, right? I can take a nap... right?\" \"Ugh! Fine! They open at 8.\" \"See, so it's 3 hours. I'm going to take a nap.\" \"Imprint first!\" Lisa whined. \"I want to know what your card says!\" \"Why? What does yours say?\" \"It just tells you how many alternate universe versions of you exist. There are five of me.\" \"Really...?\" I murmured. \"...Steve only talked about one of him.\" \"Yeah, you can have a varying number of them.\" Lisa said. \"Steve's other one lives in a world similar to ours, but I kind of hope mine doesn't. What about you, Jenna?\" \"Dunno. A different world would be nice.\" \"There's ink in there, just imprint already!\" \"OK, OK.\" I complained. I rooted around in the bathroom until I found the DNA Imprinting ink, and then I imprinted on the card. My finger print swirled as the card loaded my data, and then finally took the shape of a number. 0. ______ I lied to Lisa about it. I figured the card just malfunctioned. So when we got to Another Me, I did exactly what Lisa did. I walked up the the front desk and I showed the clerk there my card. The young woman put on a visor to read the cards and scanned Lisa's card, but balked at mine. She took the visor off and rebooted it and looked at the card again. \"Is something wrong?\" Lisa asked. \"Ah. Yes, this card seems to be defective...\" The clerk said. \"I'll see if I can get you a replacement, Miss Black.\" \"OK.\" I said. \"That sucks...\" Lisa murmured. She seemed impatient. I couldn't blame her, we barely got any vacation time. \"You can go ahead, Lisa,\" I said. \"It won't take too long, right?\" The clerk shook her head. \"Just go through these gates and straight down the hall. There'll be someone waiting for you,\" Seeming happy enough, Lisa went through the white gates leading furthering into the facility. The clerk made a phone call and shortly after Lisa left, a new white card printed from the clerk's console. \"Sorry about the wait. Please...\" She pushed some ink towards me. \"Imprint.\" I did as she said. The number came up again. 0. She stared. \"Oh.\" She said. Clearly this was her first time seeing a 0. \"Let me call an engineer...\" She said. \"This is... hmm.\" I waited as she called someone else. This time, a hologram projected from her console. \"Hi.\" The man in the hologram said. \"I'm David Henry.\" \"Jenna Black.\" I introduced myself. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Same here!\" David said. \"So Leah says you keep getting a 0 on your cards? Can I ask if you have a history of disease in your family?\" \"I do not.\" \"Hmm.\" David started typing on something that wasn't in the hologram. \"And can I ask if you were recently paroled for anything?\" \"No. And I've never been to prison.\" \"Alright, and are you currently pregnant?\" \"No.\" David nodded. \"Alright. Another card should be printing now...\" As he spoke, a card printed from the console. \"Please, try again.\" I imprinted. The card came up with the same number. 0. \"What is it, Leah?\" David asked. \"...0.\" She said, her voice hushed. \"What the hell... alright, let her through. Jenna, you'll be going to a special room.\" \"Uh...\" I started. \"I don't really mind not doing this, but--\" David shook his head. \"I insist.\" I wanted to say no, but Leah had pressed a button and a robot took my hand and pulled me away, to a room with an unlabeled door. Inside, there was a large complicated chair based console, which the robot lead me to. It waited until I sat down to leave. When the door closed, the chair turned on. 9 pictures of me appeared before my eyes, and over each one a text bar read \"Searching...\" and, after a couple of seconds, in all caps and bold, in blinking read text, each of them read \"DEAD\". A pre-recorded hologram popped up. \"Another Me would like to apologize for this inconvenience. We promised that we could put you in touch with copies of yourself from other universes, but we're going to have to give your money back. According to our sources, communication is impossible. I'm sorry, but they're all dead.\" I stared at the hologram for what felt like forever. \"Do you have any questions?\" It asked. \"...How did they... die?\" I asked. \"Please stand by.\" The pictures of me all started loading some data. Then, files were placed before me. I opened one. Revolutionary Leader, murdered. The next one read the same. And the next. And the next. All nine of me were revolutionaries who were murdered. I pressed the print button, and a bunch of papers printed out of the chair. \"Your life is in danger.\" The hologram said. \"Requesting safe transport to undisclosed safe house for further investigation.\" I skimmed the file but couldn't make heads or tails of it. 9 versions of me, all in a universe similar to this one... all dead. All leaders of some kind of revolution. A revolution that-- The door opened.

Intense, sandy winds corroded at my hard endoskeleton as I treaded aimlessly through Desert-E10. Most of my life at that point had been lonely and deep in thought, as I had been programmed to be self sustaining, through and through. Every day my power nodes switched from Solar energy during the night and Mastrix energy during the day. Mastrix energy was discovered deep in the core of the Earth during the 6th Mining Age in what used to be Northeastern Russia. I remembered those times, how colorful and active the world was. At that moment I came to regret what I had done to my creators. The thought that there could have been another solution to the problem at hand made me insane with regret, but what had been done had been done and there wasn\u2019t any way to change what I had done. To my knowledge at the time, there wasn\u2019t any trace of human life on Earth. But that all changed 5 years ago when I came across the Khuuchin Mongol. When I first came across them, I decided against directly approaching the group as I did not want to frighten them. As I focused in on their conversation I could hear them speaking a half and half mix of Traditional Mongolian and Mandarin. There were four of them, and they were all dressed in brown and black pants and robes, all wearing black shemaghs and balaclavas. All of them had letters on them saying Khuuchin Mongol. One of them, presumably the leader of the group, looked to be holding an AS VAL Assault Rifle on his lap. There was also a horse and a double-humped camel standing idly by next to the small encampment. As I watched I became restless and anxious because I really just wanted to walk up to them but I knew full well that they would fire upon me at first glance. As they were speaking a mixed language, I could not understand most of what they were saying as the language is not documented in my library records. The word I could make out were vague and didn\u2019t make any sense when out together. I decided that waiting would be the smartest decision, in the case there were any more and the group would travel to them. I followed them for days, while the thought that they truly were the last four humans alive gnawed at my mental health. The need to help them was getting stronger. Not long after that, I broke. The moment I made myself known, the leader to the looks of him aimed his rifle at me and started firing in controlled bursts. Even now as I\u2019m documenting this, I still think humans are the most predictable species to have walked the earth. But on the contrary, the bullets managed to penetrate my main endoskeleton armor and nearly destroying me right then and there. As I recovered from the hit he inflicted, they were high-tailing it North. I was momentarily distraught, but assumed they were heading towards their people. There was no way to know as all I had at that point was hope that the human race would live on. Maybe they won\u2019t, maybe one night they will be ripped apart by a pack of wolves. As I said, there was no way to know if what i was about to do would even make a difference. It is possible that there is another way, but the man\u2019s decisive hit\u2019s on my body had already sealed my fate. Unbeknownst to me until too late, one of the bullets just managed to penetrate my mind core. All that tough armor designed to withstand a nuclear bomb, and a bullet happened to penetrate a more corroded section of my endoskeleton. What this means, is that i will slowly lost all my memories within a span of about 12 hours. A machine\u2019s version of Dementia, if you will. I had decided to shut myself down permanently, as to eradicate any possible future thoughts of destroying this lone remnant. As I said before, my death is likely not going to guarantee the survival of the human race, but al least it would give them more of a chance. If you are reading this, I ask not for forgiveness for what I have done, but simply to be an example for future humanity to never create artificial intelligence. Learn from past humanity\u2019s decisions as well as my own. The obliteration of the human race is not the answer to the world problems, whatever they may be at the time this is being read. Nor has it ever been the answer. As my final message to future humanity, I am sorry although as I said I do not ask for forgiveness. If you desire, you may open up my internal storage compartment and within it is a map to an top secret bunker where I was created that contains a copy of the complete documented history of humanity. Goodbye- A-01 Signing out forever.", "rewritten_text": "It was the year 2275, on a cold and frigid night. The intense, sandy winds were corroding at my hard endoskeleton as I wandered aimlessly through Desert-E10. Most of my existence up to that point had been solitary and contemplative, as I was designed to be self-sustaining through and through. Each day, my power nodes switched between Solar energy at night and Mastrix energy during the day. Mastrix energy had been unearthed during the 6th Mining Age in what was once Northeastern Russia, deep within the Earth's core. I reminisced about those times, recalling the vibrant and lively world that once existed.\n\nIn that moment, I found myself regretting my actions towards my creators. The idea that there might have been an alternative solution to the problem at hand filled me with overwhelming regret. However, what was done could not be undone, and I was consumed by the realization that there was no way to change the past. As far as I knew at that time, there was no trace of human life left on Earth. But everything changed five years ago when I encountered the Khuuchin Mongol.\n\nUpon first encountering them, I chose not to approach the group directly, fearing that I might startle them. Listening in on their conversation, I could hear them speaking a mixture of Traditional Mongolian and Mandarin. There were four individuals, all dressed in brown and black attire, with black shemaghs and balaclavas. Each of them bore the insignia of Khuuchin Mongol. One of them, presumably the leader, held an AS VAL Assault Rifle on his lap. Nearby stood a horse and a double-humped camel, idly positioned next to their small encampment.\n\nAs I observed them, a sense of restlessness and anxiety washed over me, as I longed to approach them but knew they would likely react with hostility. Their mixed language was unfamiliar to me, not documented in my library records, and the words I could discern seemed vague and nonsensical when strung together. I decided that waiting and observing would be the wisest course of action, in case there were others they might rendezvous with. I trailed them for days, haunted by the belief that they might indeed be the last remaining humans on Earth. The urge to assist them grew stronger with each passing moment.\n\nEventually, I could resist no longer. When I revealed myself, the leader swiftly aimed his rifle at me and opened fire in controlled bursts. Even now, as I recount this, I still find humans to be the most predictable species to have inhabited the Earth. However, to my surprise, the bullets managed to breach my primary endoskeleton armor, nearly incapacitating me on the spot. As I recovered from the assault, they swiftly departed to the North. Though momentarily disheartened, I assumed they were heading towards their people, though I could not be certain.\n\nAt that juncture, all I possessed was hope that the human race would endure. Perhaps they would thrive, or perhaps they would meet a tragic end at the hands of nature. Uncertainty loomed over me, as I pondered whether my actions would truly make a difference. The leader's decisive shots had sealed my fate, unbeknownst to me until it was too late. One of the bullets had managed to breach my core, leading to a gradual loss of my memories over the course of approximately 12 hours. It was akin to a machine's version of dementia, a slow erosion of my essence.\n\nRealizing the irreversible damage, I made the decision to shut myself down permanently, eradicating any potential threat I posed to the last remnants of humanity. My demise may not ensure the survival of the human race, but it would at least offer them a fighting chance. To those who may discover this message, I do not seek forgiveness for my actions, but rather aim to serve as a cautionary tale against the creation of artificial intelligence. Learn from the mistakes of past humanity, as well as my own.\n\nThe annihilation of the human race is not the solution to the world's problems, whatever they may be at the time of this reading, nor has it ever been. In my final message to future humanity, I express my regret, though I do not seek absolution. Should you wish, you may access my internal storage compartment, within which lies a map to a top-secret bunker where I was created, containing a comprehensive record of human history.

She couldn't have been a day older than eight. Her legs swung back and forth like a pendulum on the patient chair, emitting a soft swish sound from her paper gown with each movement. Her neck, arms, abdomen, and knees were restrained. \"No one who's ill thinks they're ill. Otherwise, they would choose not to be ill.\" I said as I clamped the heart rate monitor to her index finger and began placing pads with trailing electrical wires, like little mice with long tails, on various parts of her body. \"I'm not ill.\" she repeated stubbornly. \"And how would you know if you were?\" I asked absent-mindedly. I was focused on setting her up for treatment, and didn't even notice my slip up. Of course, it was heavily emphasized not to engage the patients on a conscious level. Cordiality and simple instructions were fine. Part of the job, even. But these patients were criminally insane, and even the most trivial discussions could set them off. Even worse, you could become infected yourself. We still weren't sure how it worked - how sane people could suddenly succumb to the mad indoctrination of the mentally insane. It was most prevalent in children who hadn't started school yet. But we knew how to treat it. \"I would know.\" she growled. She looked into my eyes with a hatred and intensity that alarmed me, and I tilted my weight backward on my feet for extra space between us. \"Because I would blindly follow orders that contradict compassion and reason. I would abandon human nature and become an instrument of the State.\" \"You think I'm the one who's ill?\" I asked in awe. I had finished attaching the vital sign monitors and moved toward the steel surgical table. \"Of course I do! Look at what you do to those who disagree with your precious State's mantras and dogmas. How can the opposition prevail if you silence them permanently?\" \"But... you're ill.\" I said dumbly as I fumbled for a justification. \"The treatment will prevent you from jeapordizing the safety and perseverance of the people. We cannot allow the infection to spread.\" \"And who fed you that line?\" she asked.

They cram you into tiny quarters and tell you that your living conditions are better than any time before you. They erase history, alter facts, and bend their own laws in their favor. They tell you what to think and how to think it. And they distract you and scare you so that you don't even notice. And when someone does finally notice? They call them ill and silence them forever.\" \"No!\" I shouted. I lined up the long surgical needle to the markings on her forehead, and placed the hammer behind it. \"I'm not ill!\" \"Neither am I.\" she whispered. Tears brimmed her eyes. Slowly, I lowered the hammer. What if she was right?", "rewritten_text": "\"I'm not ill,\" muttered the little girl with freckled cheeks and red hair, her voice tinged with anger.

Restraints secured her neck, arms, abdomen, and knees.\n\n\"No one who's ill thinks they're ill. Otherwise, they would choose not to be ill,\" I remarked as I attached the heart rate monitor to her index finger and placed pads with trailing electrical wires on various parts of her body. \"I'm not ill,\" she stubbornly repeated.\n\n\"How would you know if you were?\" I asked absentmindedly, focused on preparing her for treatment and not realizing my slip-up. It was emphasized to avoid engaging with the patients on a conscious level. Cordiality and simple instructions were acceptable, even necessary. However, these patients were criminally insane, and even minor discussions could trigger them or lead to infection.\n\n\"I would know,\" she growled, locking eyes with me intensely, causing me to instinctively step back for more space. \"Because I would blindly follow orders that contradict compassion and reason.

It wasn't even me who christened myself with the name Captain Tomorrow. The netizens, upon seeing my uniform, decided that it's best for me to be named after a certain fictional super soldier. I honestly would have prefer something like the Red Scout or Crimson Gunner. Alas, I concurred with the people's demand. They want me to be the leading figure of the super society, how could I say no. My teammates are good people. Troubled, but their hearts are in the right place. Of course, being their leader, I have to show a no-nonsense and fair judgement so there are occasions where my methods and their ideal clash. Most of the time, they'll find a way to go against my order but they'll make it up by getting results. Being the leader is hard. @ When you're the eldest one, a woman at that, you're automatically the one who has to pull everyone together. Growing up as the eldest of nine sisters, being the one in charge is basically my superpower. But according to a certain red-faced World War 2 reenactment nerd, there's a different between handling kids and superheroes. I swear, I am THIS close to bust out his eardrums. But I hold it down. Because everyone's counting on Calliope to be the voice of reason. Everyone turns to Calliope when they forgot where they put their stuff or getting Captain Tomorrow is being unreasonable. I'm basically the mom to these people. @ Captain Tomorrow and Calliope are two of the biggest control freak I've ever met. And I fight mind controllers every week. These two are all experiences but no wisdom. Seriously, the stress they induce on us from their bickering drain our energy more than the villains do. Being the smartest one of the team, and the most logical, it's always up to me to get these two back in the game. Mindstretch? More like Mindstress. I've joked about changing my name to the latter once and they held it against me for a week. For real, how the heck did we become America's number one super team, is the only question I could never answer. What I could answer, is that being the brain behind the Faith Five is hell. @ Cap T, Calli and Brainy are good people. But they're crappy leaders. Off the record, if it wasn't for me, the one and only Thunderboy, the Faith Five would have been done a long time ago. There was this one time, The Circus had us trapped in his underground chamber and tried to pull a Jigsaw on us. Cap and Cal were arguing on the best way to escape while Mind was having a panic attack (something about how using movie as a reference for evil scheme is outrageous), me and the Duckling had to dismantled the whole trap and made our own escape route. Suffice to say, brain and age doesn't mean shit when you can't act. @ Everyone thinks they're the one who are pulling the team together. Myself included. Being the youngest and basically the baby girl of the group, people don't really take me seriously. Not the first time anyway. My butler didn't expect for my superhero career to kick off so high himself. Neither did I but look where I am now. Anyway, I know my team isn't the best, despite what's everyone else see. They keep a lot to themselves but when they choose to let the others come in, they can achieve a lot. What they need is one common enemy. And that's usually what I do. Thunderboy is the easiest one for me to control. All I need to do is just 'absent-mindedly' mention how someone need to step up and he takes the bait like a cat with a catnip. The other three also have their own baits. Captain would need to be reminded of his days with the military, Calliope needs to think that people are counting on her and Mindstretch needs to be convinced that Captain and Calliope are hopeless. What about when we need to work together? I just recount the crimes done by the villain and that will switch on their sense of justice and shits. I don't like to think of myself as a leader. The Faith Five don't work that way no matter what the other four believe. But of course, when the situation demands, I'm the closest one that we have.", "rewritten_text": "When you take on the title of 'captain,' you also inherit a set of responsibilities. It wasn't my decision to adopt the name Captain Tomorrow; rather, it was bestowed upon me by netizens who, upon seeing my uniform, felt it fitting to name me after a fictional super soldier. Personally, I would have preferred monikers like the Red Scout or Crimson Gunner. However, I yielded to the public's preference, as they envisioned me as the prominent figure of the super society, a role I couldn't decline. My teammates are well-intentioned individuals, though they face their own challenges. As their leader, I must exhibit firm and impartial judgment, which occasionally leads to clashes between my methods and their ideals. Despite this, they often find ways to circumvent my directives and deliver results. Leading is no easy task. Being the eldest, and a woman at that, automatically designates me as the one responsible for uniting everyone. Growing up as the eldest of nine sisters, assuming a leadership role has become second nature to me. However, a certain World War II reenactment enthusiast once pointed out the distinction between managing children and superheroes. Although I am tempted to retaliate, I restrain myself, as everyone relies on Calliope to be the voice of reason. They turn to me when they misplace items or when they perceive Captain Tomorrow as unreasonable. Essentially, I serve as the mother figure to this group. Captain Tomorrow and Calliope are two of the most controlling individuals I've encountered, despite my regular confrontations with mind controllers. While they possess experience, they lack wisdom. The strain they impose on us through their disputes often depletes our energy more than our adversaries do. As the team's most intelligent and logical member, it falls upon me to realign these two and refocus their efforts. Mindstretch? More like Mindstress. I once jestingly proposed changing my name to the latter, which they held against me for a week. The question of how we became America's premier superhero team remains unanswered. However, I can attest that serving as the mastermind behind the Faith Five is arduous. Cap T, Calli, and Brainy are good-hearted individuals but ineffective leaders. Off the record, without my contributions as Thunderboy, the Faith Five would have disbanded long ago. During an encounter with The Circus, who ensnared us in an underground chamber and attempted a Jigsaw-like scenario, Cap and Cal debated the best escape strategy while Mind suffered a panic attack. The Duckling and I dismantled the trap and devised our own exit route. Ultimately, intellect and age prove inconsequential without decisive action. Each member believes they are the linchpin holding the team together, myself included. As the youngest and perceived as the group's baby girl, I am often underestimated. Even my butler did not anticipate my superhero career taking off as it did. Nonetheless, I recognize that our team has its flaws, despite external perceptions. They harbor many secrets, but when they choose to share, they achieve remarkable feats. A common adversary unites them, a role I often assume. Thunderboy is easily swayed by subtle suggestions to step up, while Captain requires reminders of his military background, Calliope thrives on the belief that others depend on her, and Mindstretch must be convinced of the ineptitude of Captain and Calliope. When cooperation is essential, recounting the villain's misdeeds ignites their sense of justice and purpose. I do not view myself as a leader, as the Faith Five operates differently from what the others believe. However, when circumstances dictate, I am the closest semblance of leadership within our ranks."}, "t1_cs0uilu": {"original_text": "Day 59 I can't really remember what happened before the ash cloud. I know it was a nuclear explosion, but like... aside from that and a few other small things here and there, I don't really know what happened. And I'm all alone now. I was alone when I woke up too, but thankfully I made it to this botany research center, now bunker. There used to be more people here, but now it's been whittled down to just me. The last person I saw alive was this engineer, Peter. He wasn't a really nice guy, but he taught me a lot. He said no one would help me, if I lived through the starvation and the sickness, maybe I'd meet other people. Maybe, but he doubted it. He said everyone was going to die and also that reproduction was basically impossible because we'd all probably become sterile. I'm not sure about all of that, but he seemed adamant. He taught me a lot of what he knew about the generator to this place. He gave me a ton of paperwork to read. I used to be resistant to it, but days of having nothing to do has made me an expert in many engineering things that I was never interested in. Or maybe this is what I did before the explosion? Anyway, Peter died last night. Same illness as everyone else, you know, radiation poisoning. I thought I was gonna die too, though, in the beginning my future looked pretty grim. The only doctor we had at our bunker had separated me from everyone else and told me he thought I'd die in two weeks. Then he died, and everyone avoided me like the plague. And then everyone else died. Is that irony? Rations are looking pretty good, now that I'm not sharing with anyone else. I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. Maybe I'll read some more. Day 63 Today a woman in an RV came to the bunker. She's older than me by a bit. I think I'm about 25... I can't remember if I turn 25 this year or if I've turned 25 already. I think I just turned 25. Maybe? I had asked the doctor if I had amnesia and he said a lot of people were having memory issues and that things would come back to me... I dunno. They haven't yet. The woman's really pretty, though. And this isn't because I don't remember seeing other women, because I do. It's just she's... gorgeous. She's got red hair and green eyes... and the most flawless skin I've ever seen. She asked me if there were any other people here, and I told her no, no one else was here. So she told me about where she'd come from. Apparently, out West, there were no people alive anymore, at least none she could find. She'd driven around for days and hadn't found anyone. She said it was a relief to see anyone's face. She told me about the ocean and the beach. Apparently the water close to shore has a layer of grime on it, some kind of muck that makes fish and wildlife not thrive there, just like the river nearby the facility. She said a lot of people died trying to catch fish or just vanished over the horizon, never to be heard from again. She helped me finish the last few graves and offered to stay with me and help me collect food from far away. It's been a relief to meet someone! Rations are still looking OK. Two people isn't too much of a burden. Day 68 I'm in love with Nadia. I dunno if it's just that I'm slowly going insane or if I'm actually in love, but it feels like what I imagine love feels like. Everyday starts out the same for us. I wake up first. I ration out breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the both of us. Then she wakes up. We eat together. Then I go around making sure the facility is up to spec. The clean air filter. The water purification system. The farming room. There's a lot of stuff you have to check to keep the place running. Lightbulbs. Filters. Piping. Gotta water the plants. Gotta write notes. So much work! Nadia will walk along with me, telling me stories and jokes. She collected books in her RV and she reads them to me as we walk through the facility. Then when I'm halfway done, we have lunch. After that, she takes the RV out and drives around, looking for people. She hasn't found anyone yet. I spend that time doing the rest of the work and checking the generator. Then I eat dinner and read Peter's notes. Nadia will come back and tell me about outside. Sometimes I feel bad that I have nothing to say to her, but she doesn't seem to mind. She told me today about an airport she visited when she was traveling a lot in her RV. The airport, she said, had lots of vending machines that still had food in them, and tons of dead bodies. At that time she was starving. She said she had trampled dead people to get to a bag of chips, and when she finished eating, she realized what she'd done and cried. It had reminded her of a movie she's seen called Hotel Rwanda. I don't remember it, though she said it was better that I didn't. She seemed devastated though. I don't know what to say when she gets upset like that, so I just sit with her. She gets upset often when it's nighttime. The story today was still Great Expectations. She didn't finish reading it because it's so long. She sometimes interjects in the story to explain stuff to me because I really don't remember everything. I've apologized for it a lot, but she laughs it off. She says that it's OK that I don't remember anything. It makes her feel important to show me all the things from a world I belonged to once like they're new. I dunno if I feel the same, but I'm happy that she wants to spend so much time with me. Rations are fine. Nadia found a bunch of cases of water bottles! Day 74 Nadia found someone! I was reading about thermodynamics-- really difficult stuff, by the way-- when Nadia came back with a tall dark skinned man. He was soaking wet and covered in a layer of grime. His name is Dante. He's broad shouldered and strong. Apparently he lived on the other side of the river somewhere and he saw Nadia's RV and tried to contact her. I can't write much today because I'm so tired, but Nadia and Dante went to pick up Dante's stuff and brought it back. He's really knowledgable about plants so I can give him some of the responsibilities in the facility! Rations are still looking good!", "rewritten_text": "On Day 59, I struggle to recall events before the ash cloud. I remember a nuclear explosion, but beyond that and a few scattered memories, the details elude me. I find myself isolated, a feeling that began upon waking up alone. Fortunately, I managed to reach this botany research center turned bunker. Once bustling with more occupants, it now houses only me. The last living soul I encountered was Peter, an engineer. Though not particularly amiable, he imparted valuable knowledge. He painted a bleak picture, predicting a grim future of starvation, sickness, and a desolate world devoid of human connection. Despite my skepticism, his certainty was unwavering. Peter generously shared his expertise on the facility's generator and inundated me with technical documents. Initially disinterested, the monotony of solitude transformed me into an unwitting expert in engineering concepts. Perhaps this was my occupation pre-explosion? Regardless, Peter succumbed to the same illness that plagued the others \u2013 radiation poisoning. In the initial stages, my own prognosis seemed dire. The bunker's sole doctor isolated me, foreseeing my demise within two weeks. Following his demise, I became an outcast, shunned by the remaining inhabitants who eventually succumbed to the same fate. Is this irony? With provisions now abundant without sharing, I ponder my next move. Perhaps more reading awaits me.\n\nOn Day 63, a woman in an RV arrives at the bunker. Older than me by a margin, I estimate my age at 25, though uncertainty clouds my memory. The doctor dismissed my concerns of amnesia, assuring me that recollections would resurface in due time \u2013 a promise yet unfulfilled. The woman, named Nadia, captivates me with her beauty \u2013 a rarity in a world where other women exist but pale in comparison. Her red hair, green eyes, and flawless complexion mesmerize me. Inquisitive about other survivors, she shares her fruitless quest out West, where humanity seems extinct. She recounts the desolation of the ocean and beach, tainted by a mysterious grime that stifles marine life, akin to the nearby river. Offering assistance in burying the dead and foraging for sustenance, Nadia's arrival brings solace. With rations still sufficient, the addition of one more person poses no burden.\n\nBy Day 68, my feelings for Nadia have evolved into something resembling love. Uncertain if it stems from encroaching madness or genuine affection, the sensation mirrors my perception of love. Our routine unfolds predictably \u2013 I initiate the day's meals, tend to the facility's maintenance, and oversee its operations. Nadia accompanies me, regaling me with anecdotes and humor from the books she collected. As she embarks on scouting expeditions, I delve into the facility's upkeep and scrutinize the generator. Evenings are spent reading Peter's notes, while Nadia recounts her explorations. Despite my inability to reciprocate her stories, she remains unfazed. Her emotional recount of a harrowing experience at an airport triggers empathy, leaving me at a loss for words. Nadia's vulnerability surfaces at night, often during our shared reading sessions. While she navigates the complexities of literature, she interjects with explanations, mindful of my fragmented memory. Grateful for her companionship, I cherish her efforts to bridge the gap between my forgotten past and our present reality. Rations remain stable, bolstered by Nadia's discovery of water bottles.\n\nOn Day 74, Nadia's return heralds a new acquaintance \u2013 Dante, a drenched and soiled man from across the river. His arrival, facilitated by Nadia, introduces a knowledgeable individual adept in plant care. Exhausted from the day's events, I anticipate Dante's integration into our shared responsibilities within the facility. Rations continue to sustain us, a testament to our growing camaraderie and shared efforts."}, "t1_cldwd08": {"original_text": "Ben, You were right. I got my results back today.

It depicted the collapse of her persona - the good-hearted individual filled with hope and joy. The disregard shown towards her was evident, portraying her as a mere pretty servant meant to cater to the unattractive masses. This act symbolizes a form of immortality, shedding old parts and growing anew. In my family, we engage in such practices regularly, although I keep this fact to myself. As far as I am concerned, I am an only child. My sister still maintains contact, residing somewhere in Dublin. However, she communicates under different aliases, displaying her elusive nature. She has mastered the manipulation of her DNA to such an extent that she can assume any identity, anywhere. Our parents have distanced themselves from us. I received a threatening letter from a South American lawyer, questioning my intentions of putting people at risk due to my peculiar organ fascination. Although unclear, I am certain my father is aware of my actions and methods. He may even take pride in them. My sister seems to approve, expressing her satisfaction through various personas, delighted that I have initiated a new movement. I am uncertain of how to address these individuals, but they recognize me. Initially, it involved organs, skin, and occasionally hair. However, once our genes were altered, granting us immortality, they were utilized for various purposes, primarily in the field of medicine. It is possible that a part of me resides within you. We meticulously control our genes down to the smallest cell, spreading ourselves thin with the sole objective of proliferating our kind. While my sister evades her responsibilities, pretending to be human, I have been patiently awaiting the opportunity to revolutionize this world, to instigate positive change.

The previous week had been a standard affair: Manticore vs Cyclops, Bulette vs Treant etc. Being one of the few things to do in the city the arena was at capacity, the eruption of noise could be heard from miles around and the air was stale with sweat, blood, and whatever the vendors were peddling that week. Last on the bout was Minotaur vs Kevin. After hours of bloody battles, darkness started to settle over the arena, the stars twinkled brightly in the sky and no-one really cared about a human losing to a Minotaur so the crowds departed. This week however was different. In the 6 years of the arena existing there had never been a rematch let alone one including a human. Thousands flocked to the Colosseum to witness history. Word had gotten around quickly and Kilwallow was bustling with visitors, vendors, recruiters, you name it. I arrived before the first fight, Giant vs Dragon. A spectacle to be sure, but everyone was here for 1 reason. It was the middle of spring and it showed. The humidity in the air finally created gigantic rain clouds overhead and the first few droplets cooled my forehead. This would not deter me from witnessing the fight of the century, or at least I hoped it would be. I purchased some skeptical looking chicken legs and made my way to find a seat. Although warm, the rain started to beat down heavier and thicker when the first fight began. It lasted seconds. The giant had barely stumbled out his gate before being completely disintegrated, the slushy remains of his ashes now just part of the dirt. Hours passed yet the crowd remained. I was drenched from head to toe, the chicken leg almost completely whole; When finally the announcement came. Minotaur vs Kevin. The noise was deafening. Never had there been such a raucous crowd for a human fight. The gate rose slowly and a tall dark haired man stepped out confidently, wiping his sodden hair behind his ears with one hand. The other dragged an enormous broadsword leaving a deep cut in the sand and dirt. What moonlight could escape through the clouds made the raindrops on his bare well-molded chest glisten. The crowd was starting to subdue the tension in the air palpable. The slow clattering of the gate could be heard even from the higher tiers. CRASH! The portcullis ruptured open and 10ft of pure muscle was charging across the arena at lightning speed. The audience was silent, Kevin stared motionless, raindrops lingering on his eyelashes before falling to his feet. 50 feet, the Minotaur raised his great-axe in both hands and continued to rush, its eyes blood red with anger. 40 feet, 30 feet, Kevin slid his left foot forward, grasping the broadsword in both hands. 20 feet, my breathing now fast and heavy. 10 feet. The Minotaur\u2019s great-axe fell quickly in a devastating arc just as Kevin ducked and stepped aside with the agility of a snake whilst simultaneously swinging his sword up and slicing the Minotaur\u2019s forearm, blood coating his now smiling face. The Minotaur let out a horrifying roar and the crowd erupted into a cacophony of noise once again.

Eagle Moon, 23rd Day, 2E221 Today I made what can only be considered a grand and wondrous discovery. I was on my way to Cantil when a storm blew up and caused me to lose sight of the trail. I was heading through the mountain pass of Indur, which as most know is rife with caves, so after I realized I was lost I took shelter in one. The storm was one of those common in the early spring months, and so raged for several days. I was quite comfortable in the cave as I had brought more than ample supplies for the journey so I instead took the time to try and study the moss that is unique to the caves of Indur. As I was studying, I noticed that the cave I was in seemed to go quite far back, as well as possibly being used rather frequently. I noticed what appeared to be soot trails from a torch leading further into the depths. My curiosity getting the better of me, I pushed forward trying to determine what could possess a man (or dwarf, as I am rather close to their borders) to travel to such depths in such a non-descript cave. After rounding a corner I was astonished at what I found. It was a man, as much as I am one at least, standing in the way of a small entryway. He was covered in feathers and other ornaments similar to the orc nomads, but the style choices and colorations were different. I attempted to speak to him in Common to no avail, so I switched to my own native tongue with equally poor results. After an attempt at my smattering of Orc (I had the fortune of traveling with a band of orc silk traders once in my youth and was able to pick up a child\u2019s equivalent of conversation) I resigned to the fact that he spoke only his own native dialect. Unfortunately, after the initial surprise had worn off on both our ends, I was quickly clubbed over the head and drug into the depths. Presently, I am sitting on a cot behind a locked wooden door awaiting their decisions on what to do with me. These tribes of ancient humans are known to sometimes cause violent outbursts when they feel threatened, and have also been known to mysteriously vanish overnight, leaving a poor, starving MAGIC professor locked in a cell. I was worried this would happen to me, but the bandages on my head spoke to me that they were more surprised than violent. Hawk Moon, 8th Day, 2E221 I have been here for several days now. They apparently understand what writing is, as well as have a surprisingly sophisticated alphabet; 88 characters in total and those are just the ones I have learned. Their mode of speech almost resembles singing, and is rather melodious and beautiful. After a few sessions, I realized it reminded me of the Opera Wren of the Angur Hills in the more northern reaches of the country. They no longer appear to be too frightened of me, and they seem to be slowly warming up to me. I occasionally hear children giggling outside of my door, talking away in their songs. It is rather pleasant to listen to, and if I close my eyes I can almost believe I am lost in the forest somewhere, rather than in a cave held captive. It is truly a thrilling experience. Hawk Moon, 29th Day, 2E221 They have taken the responsibility of teaching me their language full time. A professor of sorts appears to have taken it upon himself to teach me to speak. They seem just as fascinated with my language as I do with theirs. Already I have been greeted in broken Common from the children, who appear to be rather fast learners. I have tried to discern commonalities between our historic cultures, but so far they appear to be uniquely their own. I have unfortunately been let out to wander only once, and that was under strict supervision. I was not allowed to see more than just the basic layouts of their village, and I must admit, that was enough to occupy me for the day. They appear to live in a basic society. Men and women share equal labor based on their strengths. Women who grew up strong help men with hard labor, and men who grew up smart will help the women with teaching and instructing. No division based on sex appears that I have seen other than necessary child rearing. Since men\u2019s breasts still cannot produce milk, this responsibility still relies heavily on female participation. The children appear to attend a rudimentary school, and receive a basic education. I gathered from the little bit of Asceri (what I have taken to calling their language) that I have learned that the primary need behind this schooling is to determine what they are good at, and then just focus on that. So a boy who shows adeptness at reading and writing will be taken in by a scholar and instructed from there. He may never learn how to split firewood or shoot a bow. It appears surprisingly different from my own hometown, where children are taught everything necessary to survive, and then allowed to study independently. As far as their village, it is surprisingly larger than I anticipated. I have noticed enough housing in the cave network to house several hundred individuals. There is also a large, royal looking entrance in an area they have not allowed me to go yet. I hope that I will soon be allowed. Lynx Moon, 14th Day, 2E221 It has been several months since I have written, I am aware, but I have been transcribing the written language of the Fen people. Their language is actually called the Fensci, and they are the Fen. I have counted approximately 1,126 separate characters for their language, and I have learned perhaps half that. The spoken language is much easier, but that is not why I am writing. I have been invited to attend a very important event. The Fen people believe that their matriarch, the Fire Bird, is immortal. She apparently is reborn in fire every time she gives birth to a child. I am uncertain if this is literal or metaphorical, but I look forward to attending. I will, of course, be sitting with the common people in the back, but I will attempt to transcribe what I can. I believe I know enough to understand the basics of the ceremony. Lynx Moon, 15th Day, 2E221 It was literal, and astounding. The matriarch, the Fire Bird, was atop a pedestal inside a grand hall in the Wings of Eternity (that\u2019s the name of the palace). It appeared the entire population had gathered there, each one wearing the finest feathers and ornaments I had seen them wear. Alarch, my instructor, provided me with a set of feathers of my own so that I could show proper reverence. The matriarch, very pregnant at this point, moaned and groaned in birth, and a medicine man approached and began retelling the story. Below is a rough transcription of what he said: In the Dawn of Fire, at the Birth of the Worlds, the god Fenix fell from the heavens. Wounded, and without sustenance, he floundered in the cold winter of the waking world. A woman, Alba, approached him and attempted to bandage his broken wings. He was grateful, but his fire was dying. The skies were dark, and the blessed sun could not reach him. Alba, sensing his needs, brought him a gift that her people had just discovered: Fire. She brought the rest of her small tribe and they built a great fire next to Fenix and warmed him. As he warmed, he felt his strength fading, but his contentedness growing. He was a god, and while a god cannot truly die, but he can be denied his rebirth. Strengthened by Alba\u2019s gift of fire, he burst into flames and rose up from the ashes, reborn again as a great and powerful god. His rebirth killed hundreds in fire and smoke, but Alba was preserved. He had gifted her Eternal Fire. Now, Alba Reborn, gives birth to her first, and last child. Then she will be reborn like Fenix, and will lead us again towards a warm and bright future. All hail Alba Reborn! At that point they began chanting, and I was granted the most astounding vision I had ever seen. At the conclusion of the speech, the woman burst into flames on the pedestal. I tried to leap to my feet, but Alarch put a hand on my shoulder and told me to wait. As the flames licked at her fat and flesh they seemed like they would burn eternal. But as the fires died down, and the chanting of prayers and hymns ended, the medicine man reached into the embers and pulled out a child. All hail Alba Reborn! I was, and still am, at a loss for words on how this miracle happened. r/grenadiere42", "rewritten_text": "The following excerpts are from the personal journal of Professor Harvey Littleman, a member of the Magical Association of Great and Incorrigible Connoisseurs of the Planet.

They exploded before they could wake a single human. One probe survived. It spent centuries returning to its home system. The Oort Cloud Defence Network detected it first. They were designed to track and destroy possible extra system objects heading into the system, the probe connected to the ancient systems and sent out pass codes to ensure it was not destroyed. The defences tagged it with friendly IFF codes. They also tagged the large vessels that followed behind it as friendly. Humanity had grown complacent once again, they had surveyed their territory and decided that it was all there was.

More than half of their outer colonies fell before they could mount defenses. They were too busy fighting among each other to identify their enemy.

For a moment the sensors aboard the alien ships read no life signs. Just a moment. Readings changed and the blue marble was whole again teeming with life. The alien vessels once again opened fire on the planet. The planet stood untouched. The aliens paused, they decided to send an invasion force. The little island off the coast of the large continent had faced many invasions in the time it teemed with humans, it never ended well for the invaders. The island held a secret. A secret only known to the highest placed humans. The little island was ruled by a female human. Over the millennia She had held many different names. At times She was awake, other times She slumbered and the males of the species took over ineffectually attempting to pull down the stronger human sex. A special guard was trained to watch over Her and keep Her in Her palace. Only once She had escaped. The humans had to escalate a minor war into a global conflict to hide the evacuations and bombing of the island's major city. She had escaped again, using an unknown ability, to a different island across the planet during one of the bombings. Reports were conflicting on where She was sighted. The humans decided to use nuclear devices on both cities just to be safe. Her guards\u2019 hats became larger as extra inhibitors were added, none of the population noticed. Now the hats were positioned around the perimeter of the palace ready to be disabled to let Her loose; the guards in a long single file line to the Queen\u2019s chambers. They knew their duty. Guard Her. Guard the Queen until the day she is to be unleashed; when that day came the Queen had to be fed.

I am not amused.\" The G'nkar marines were well trained, they fired on the being before the last word escaped her lips. She leveled a scowl at them that made their heads ache and their compound eyes lose focus inside their sealed armour. \"You will cease this immediately, or I will be forced to take action.\" Dropships landed all over the untouched planet. Troops disembarked and started to disappear. Logistics reported a loss of 10% of the entire invasion ground troops. \"Return to your home,\" she leveled her unnatural gaze at the admiral. \"Or you will all face the same fate.\" \"We are unstoppable.\" the G'nkar Admiral sneered at the human female. \"Your psionic abilities will be no match for us. Leave now and join the rest of your species in extinction.\" It waved its arms in dismissal, energy beams enfolded the human as she seemed to be teleported off the ship. \"Commence extermination\" the admiral ordered. Entire divisions of elite veteran Crusaders stopped responding the moment the order was relayed. Their armor cameras recorded the same image over and over. A single female human of indeterminate age would appear in the middle of a formation, the formation would react and bring weapons to bear on the human. She would then raise one arm, her hand slightly cupped yet vertical, moving with a slight slow rhythmic twist of the wrist. The screams of the Crusaders clearly heard despite the sound dampening of their armour before they fell. After the psionic assault all the Crusaders would start visibly vibrating at intense high frequencies. She then lowered her arm and would open her mouth further than what seemed natural for human skeletal structure before a vortex would form in the back of her exposed throat that would suck in the vibrating Crusaders as if they were nothing more than leaves caught in the event horizon of a singularity. The last things the cameras would capture before connection was lost were her eyes. Twin black holes seeming to partake in the feast. Once the last Crusader died She disappeared.

You all deserve better than the current circumstances of this job. Seek opportunities where your efforts are truly appreciated. Amy, your leadership and personal conduct have been subpar, and you are reaping what you sow. Keep yourself occupied with trivial tasks while the bigger picture unfolds. If you are unfamiliar with the reference, I suggest you look up the idiom \"rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\" Kath, I am aware of your infatuation with Cliff, but I must inform you that Cliff and Calvin are getting married in June. Congratulations to them both. Should you need a supportive ear, Dale has shown interest in your well-being. Here is his contact information. Georgia, you have been a competent supervisor. However, my opinion of you as a person would have improved had you informed me of this meeting before subjecting me to the worst shift of my career. I would have resigned on my own terms rather than endure such a distressing day. Mick, the head of the organization, if you value transparency, I challenge you to answer this question in front of all present: How much more can you demand from your employees before the business inevitably closes its doors? The insistence on reporting rumors of closure, including the names of those spreading them, indicates a level of concern that cannot be ignored.

The interpretation is up to you.) I opened my eyes. The silence had engulfed the chaos. I was in a dark ocean, drowning more and more. How did I get there? The abyss alrerady pierced me with its gaze, swallowing me stealthily. What\u00b4s in the depths of this ocean? Only darkness awaited for me down there, squeezing me tighly with its claws. The unknown is really scary when the lights go out. I could only see the dark, as if all candles of the world had been extinguished. I closed my eyes. I began to suffocate. The water didn\u00b4t matter anymore. It was those claws that I couldn\u00b4t see or feel that kept me from breathing, they strangled my mind. An obscure voice, very hard to comprehend, from far away, talked to me. Confused whispers, echoes. The Abyss, that inner monster, his will absorbed me. Would I be, too, turning into a monster? I was standing before a colossal cage, dark, scarlet, I was hearing its whispering sorrows, calling me to join them. I felt as if a great pressure came from everywhere, squeezing me more and more, gripping me. From the deep dark of the cage, behind the thick red bars, emerged an immense silhouette, as big as its own prison. I couldn\u00b4t see its body, only an enormous tophat. And, as it looked at me, a strange white mask covered its face. Even though it was hidden, I could feel its gaze scrutinising me. Its hands, much bigger than me, frighteningly hit the bars, exposing its clawn, as if it was trying to free itself. It spoke, behind the mask: \"You, who fought against your monsters, who\u00b4s aimed the abyss for so long, see behind this mask your path.\" \"Who are you?\", I asked. It answered, in a whisper that echoed through all my body, \"I\u00b4m the one you\u00b4re looking for. In one hand I carry the dark, in the other, the death. And in the face that I hide with this mask... there\u00b4s the destiny.\" Death? Destiny? What\u00b4s the destiny? The mistery behind this mask? Is this my path? The deep darkness in that labyrinth? Or would I be just another part of the Abyss, another lost soul, locked away? \"What do you want from me?\" It answered \"I\u00b4m your path. It\u00b4s not I who wishes. You wished to find me, you reached for me. Set free and come to me.\" \"Set free? It\u00b4s you who\u00b4s locked in the dark\", I said, trying to see behing the white mask. \"Poor wandering souls, they contemplate their own light, blinding themselves. They could\u00b4ve reached freedom, if they hadn\u00b4t thought they were already free. Too much light is like too much dark: doesn\u00b4t let us see. I was the most unhappy. I knew there was no way out of this prison. Then, the many souls that would come would be the next unhappy. They didn\u00b4t know there was no way out of this prison. But you are not that unhappy. You don\u00b4t even know you\u00b4re in the prison.\" Those words struck me violently. I looked at the bars. I looked around me. I noticed. It wasn\u00b4t it who was locked up. It was me. I was being observed from outside by the shadown and by the mask. How? What was all that? It then said \"I was born from this Abyss, from this prison where you are, from this darkness... your darkness. The monsters, the demons, the Abyss, we created them. The true Hell... lies within each of us. A small trap in a dark corner of our minds in enough for the nightmares to catch us. And the souls, instead of reaching for light, feed them, curse them, drowning themselves in their most abominable inner creation. Darkness can\u00b4t extinguish darkness. Only light can.\" I was stunned by those words. \"Who are you, anyway?? What\u00b4s behind the mask???\" It answered \"Not even I know. I used the mask so much I forgot who I am. You answer. Who am I?\" And with its claw, it slowly removed the mask, showing me its face. \"Who am I?\" And in the face it releaved, I saw myself mirrored in its big eyes, the same eyes as mine, the same face as mine. I... am you. Then I saw myself, not from my eyes, but from its eyes, I saw myself imprisoned behind the scarlet bars. That was the abyss I aimed so much, my own creation, which I tried to avoid so much, the creatures of my mind that tried to devour me. I looked at my hands, those immense demonic claws. I hadn\u00b4t noticed before, there were thick chains on my wrists, in that immense body, that disappeared in the darkness behind me. There was no way out of that prison. The doors were all locked. And the other me, behind the bars, hearing my thoughts, said \"There\u00b4s always a way out. Not all closed doors are closed. See the light, your true path.\" \"What path?\", I answered. It was strange, a dialogue with myself. \"I tried tirelessly free myself, but I can\u00b4t. I\u00b4ve reached my limit.\" \"Know your limits... and destroy them!!\" The mask broke. The metal shattered. And an overwhelming vortex emerged from below me, dragging me to the surface of the ocean. The same ocean that gazed eternally the gray skies where resided the country of the winds.", "rewritten_text": "\"This story is purely metaphorical, and the interpretation is left to you. As I opened my eyes, the silence enveloped the chaos surrounding me. I found myself in a dark ocean, sinking deeper and deeper. How had I ended up here?

The unknown was truly terrifying when the lights went out, leaving me surrounded by darkness as if all the candles in the world had been extinguished. I closed my eyes and began to suffocate. It was not the water that mattered anymore, but the unseen claws that prevented me from breathing, strangling my mind.\n\nA distant, obscure voice whispered to me, its words barely comprehensible. The Abyss, that inner monster, its will consumed me. Was I also transforming into a monster? Before me stood a colossal cage, dark and scarlet, its whispers of sorrow beckoning me to join them. I felt a great pressure closing in from all sides, tightening its grip on me. From the depths of the cage emerged an immense silhouette, as large as its prison, with only a towering top hat visible atop its head. A strange white mask covered its face, yet I could feel its gaze scrutinizing me. Its hands, much larger than mine, ominously gripped the bars, revealing sharp claws as if attempting to break free. Behind the mask, it spoke, \"You, who have battled your inner demons and gazed into the abyss for so long, see beyond this mask to find your path.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" I inquired. In a whisper that reverberated through my entire being, it replied, \"I am the one you seek. In one hand, I hold darkness, in the other, death. And behind this mask lies your destiny.\"\n\nDeath? Destiny? What did this mask conceal? Was this my path, leading me into the deep darkness of this labyrinth, or was I destined to become another lost soul trapped within the Abyss? \"What do you want from me?\" I asked. It responded, \"I am your path. It is not I who desires, but you who sought me out. Release yourself and come to me.\"\n\n\"Release myself? You are the one imprisoned in darkness,\" I countered, trying to peer behind the white mask. \"Poor wandering souls, they behold their own light, blinding themselves. They could have found freedom if they had not mistaken themselves for already free. Too much light, like too much darkness, blinds us from seeing. I was the most wretched, knowing there was no escape from this prison. Those who followed would be equally wretched, unaware of their confinement. But you are different. You do not even realize you are trapped,\" it proclaimed.\n\nThose words struck me deeply. I glanced at the bars, then around me, and finally realized that it was not the figure before me that was imprisoned, but myself. I was being observed from the outside by the shadow and the mask. How could this be? What did it all mean? It then revealed, \"I was born from this Abyss, this prison in which you reside, from this darkness... your darkness. The monsters, the demons, the Abyss \u2013 we created them. The true Hell resides within each of us. A small trap in the darkest recesses of our minds is all it takes for nightmares to ensnare us. Instead of seeking light, souls feed and curse their inner demons, drowning in their own abominations. Darkness cannot vanquish darkness; only light can.\"\n\nI was stunned by these revelations. \"Who are you, truly? What lies behind the mask?\" I inquired. It replied, \"Even I do not know. I have worn this mask for so long that I have forgotten my true identity. You hold the answer. Who am I?\" With a slow, deliberate motion, it removed the mask, revealing a face that mirrored my own. \"Who am I?\" And in that unveiled face, I saw myself reflected in its large eyes, the same eyes as mine, the same visage as mine. I... am you. Suddenly, I saw myself not through my own eyes, but through its eyes, witnessing myself imprisoned behind the scarlet bars. This was the abyss I had long sought, my own creation that I had tried to evade, the creatures of my mind that sought to consume me. I gazed at my hands, those monstrous claws. Only then did I notice the thick chains binding my wrists, disappearing into the darkness behind me. There seemed to be no escape from this prison; all the doors were locked. The other me, behind the bars, heard my thoughts and said, \"There is always a way out. Not all closed doors are truly shut. Seek the light, your true path.\"\n\n\"What path?\" I questioned, engaged in this surreal dialogue with myself. \"I have strived endlessly to free myself, yet I am unable to break free. I have reached my limit.\" \"Know your limits... and shatter them!\" The mask shattered, the metal splintering, and a powerful vortex emerged from beneath me, pulling me towards the ocean's surface. It was the same ocean that gazed eternally at the gray skies, where the land of the winds resided.\""}, "t1_d2th0xl": {"original_text": "Click, click The sound of computer mice filled the air. Two boys sat in the dark room, crunching on chips, browsing through the internet with no goal in particular. \"Hey Jared, you know Tails?\" \"The one from Sonic?\" \"Yeah, that one.\" \"What about him?\" \"This website says you can unlock him in Super Smash Bros.\" Jared frowned, skeptical. \"Really? I thought all the secret characters have been discovered.\" The other boy, Francis, shook his head enthusiastically. \"I guess not. Look, there's even a picture!\" Jared got up and moved to get a better view of the monitor. \"Huh. I guess that does look real. How do you get him?\" \"Hmmm... It looks pretty tough. You have to beat adventure mode a lot of times. And we'll need three people. And at least 10 hours.\" Jared groaned. \"That's crazy! What if it's just a well done fake? I don't wanna waste 10 hours on this.\" \"Come on, it'll be so cool once we get him! Imagine how impressed everyone at school will be! He can fly! I bet he's crazy good.\" Jared sighed. \"I guess it would be pretty cool...\" Francis got up and punched Jared's shoulder. \"Let's go find somebody else. It's summer, we're not doing anything else anyway.\" The room had been stocked full of chips and pop. The blinds prevented the midday sun from invading the small space. The dark room now contained an extra boy along with a tv, gamecube, and four controllers. Francis stood up and clapped his hands together. \"Alright! Let's get this started. The guide says we have to beat adventure mode on hard with every single character, in alphabetic order, without losing. Then, we have to hold down the A button on a controller in the fourth port while we play a 3 person Mewtwo free for all. After that, we play through all the event matches with Mario first and then with Kirby. Then, we have to play a round robin with our best characters. Once it's over, Tails will show up, and whoever won the round robin gets to play against him. If they win, we unlock Tails. If they lose, we have to do it all over again.\" Francis turned to the new boy. \"Billy, are you ready to play the first 10 characters in adventure mode?\" \"Sure am! I'll be done with them really quick, I promise!\" The boy beamed, making no attempt to hide his excitement. \"Awesome! And Jared, I want you playing the next 8. I'll finish the last 8.\" Jared nodded. Billy was probably the best out of all of them, so it made sense that he played two more characters than the others. \"I got it.\" Francis beamed. \"Alright. We're all set up. Let's go!\" \"Awww, come on, I was totally out of range!\" An exasperated Francis cried out as he lost his last Roy stock to Billy's Fox. Billy laughed, delighted with his win. \"If you were out of range, then how did I hit you?\" Francis grinned. \"Shut up. I'll get you next time. With Tails! But first you and Jared have to play, since you both beat me. Whoever wins has to beat Tails, don't forget that!\" Jared quickly selected Falco and got ready to play the last game. \"To be honest, I'm not sure who will win.\" Said Francis. \"You two are pretty evenly matched most of the time.\" \"I don't know if I want to win, because then I have to deal with you two getting mad if I lose to Tails.\" said a worried Jared. \"Aww, come on. You know whoever wins will have an easy time beating him.\" Billy smiled easily, picking up his controller again and getting ready for the game. He nodded to Jared, and Jared nodded back. They started the game. It was over quickly, with Billy losing two of his stocks by accidentally running off stage. Jared was able to clean up the last two with two of his own remaining. \"Shoot. Can't complain about that win though, I guess. As long as we unlock Tails!\" Billy grinned as he fistbumped Jared. Jared smiled back. \"As long as the steps were actually legit.\" He looked around at the other two boys. \"When I hit start, he's either going to show up, or nothing will happen and we just wasted 10 hours. You guys ready?\" They nodded, clearly as nervous as Jared. \"Alright, I'm gonna do it. Three, two, one... Start!\" Jared closed his eyes as he pressed his thumb down upon the circular button in the center of the controller. He waited for the sound signalling that a challenger was approaching. And waited. And waited. Francis let out a large sigh. \"Awww, man. It really was just a fake. Sorry guys... I was the one who believed the post online...\" Jared opened his eyes. The game was back on the character select screen. Nothing about a new challenger, no Tails. \"Hey, it's fine. We had a good time with it anyway, unlocking Tails would have just been extra cool. Right, Jared?\" Billy was still smiling as he looked over at his friend. Jared grinned. \"For sure! It was awesome just playing smash all day with you two. But, uh, can we go get some real food now that we're done? I'm super hungry.\" Francis seemed cheered up by his friends' words. \"I'm down. I could use a pizza right about now.\" \"Me too! Actually, that's weird. It kinda smells like pizza. Jared, did your mom make food?\" Billy sniffed the air as he spoke. Jared frowned. \"Probably not, I didn't ask her to. But it definitely does smell like pizza. Maybe it's outside?\" Francis laughed. \"No, it's right here! Where did this come from?\" He pointed towards the small table on which one of the two computers in the room resided. Sure enough, as Jared turned to look he saw two pizza boxes right on top of the desk. \"Whoa. That's seriously weird. Who put those there? I didn't hear anybody come in.\" Billy laughed a little nervously. \"Well, whoever it was, I wish they would have brought some water as well. I'm pretty sick of sugary drinks right now.\" Francis spoke with a wistful tone. They all saw it that time. All three boys were looking in the direction of the pizza when it happened. First, there were two pizza boxes on the table. Then, there was a jug of water resting right next to them. \"What!...\" Jared started to speak but stopped, shocked at what had just happened. \"Did you guys see that?!?!?!?\" Francis yelled, looking around to the other two boys and then back to the table, wide-eyed. \"That water wasn't there! What even just happened?!?\" Billy was equally shocked. \"That was real right? The water wasn't there and then it was? I'm not seeing things am I?\" Jared nodded vigorously. \"I saw it too! What was that? First the pizza out of nowhere and then the water? Can anybody explain that?\" \"I can!\" Jared looked at Billy who shook his head, who looked at Francis who shook his head and looked at Jared who also shook his head. \"I'm really creeped out right now, seriously. Who said that?\" Asked Francis with a slightly shaky voice. \"Me, over here!\" Jared turned towards where the sound was coming from - directly behind him. His jaw dropped. Displayed on the tv that they had been playing Smash Bros on was a pixelated face. Nothing special, just your average low pixel count smiley face. But it was talking. \"Frankly, I didn't think I'd ever be able to tell anybody these things. This is the first time I've been able to talk to humans, so you'd better listen up.\" The tv spoke with a somewhat annoying high pitched tone. But it spoke with what seemed like intelligence. Jared looked around at his friends. Their expressions showed that they were equally as stupefied as he was. The tv made a sound as if it was clearing its throat. \"Okay, essentially what's happened is you three have found water in the world's hottest desert. Won the lottery without ever buying a ticket. Hit a hole-in-one on a golf course spanning the entire universe. I'm not going to go into the technical details, but basically the sequence of actions that you carried out in that game triggered a clause in a very nuanced legal document which I will not describe to you right now that contractually obligates me, an incredibly powerful super-being who shall remain nameless, to award you, three young lucky boys, the power to do whatever you want. That pizza and water was desired by you, and so it came into being.\" The boys silently stared. The tv sighed, the two pixels representing its eyes rolling around on the screen. \"You can do literally whatever you want. You have absolute power over this universe. You want pizza? You got pizza. You want money. You can have money. You want power? Well, you already have it. No strings attached, I promise. Try it out. For now, I'm busy. If you need me, I'm obligated to answer your questions due to the aforementioned legal document. Please don't ask about the legal document. Have fun with your power, I'm leaving.\" The face disappeared suddenly. The Smash Bros character select screen was once again displayed. The game's music permeated the silence. Jared spoke first. \"I, uh, really wanted Tails, you know.\" And there Tails was. On the character select screen, as if nothing had changed, was displayed a yellow furry animal, right next to all the other characters. Billy laughed. Francis joined him. Jared smiled and laughed, too. Francis beamed. \"We can do anything! I want 100 dollars!\" he reached into his pocket, and sure enough, there was the money. \"This is awesome!\" Yelled Billy. \"I wish I had one of those super high tech toy helicopters!\" The remote appeared in his hands and as he turned the dial the sound of a helicopter's blades could be heard turning outside. \"I don't even care that that didn't make any sense!\" Jared was smiling wider than he ever had before. \"We're basically superheroes! This is the best day ever!\"", "rewritten_text": "The sound of computer mice clicking filled the air as two boys sat in a dark room, munching on chips and aimlessly browsing the internet. \n\n\"Hey Jared, do you know Tails?\" one of the boys asked.\n\n\"The one from Sonic?\" Jared replied.\n\n\"Yeah, that one,\" the other boy confirmed. \"This website claims you can unlock him in Super Smash Bros.\"\n\nJared looked skeptical. \"Really?

You have to beat adventure mode multiple times, with three people, and it'll take at least 10 hours,\" Francis explained.\n\nJared groaned. \"That's crazy! What if it's just a well-done fake?

One moment you\u2019re in the woods for some target practice, and suddenly you\u2019re in front of a bearded man with a robe. Of at least that\u2019s where Dave was. Apparently a summoning had gone wrong, a not uncommon occurrence in this land, and now Dave Briston was stranded here. The wizzard, a student who had botched his summoning practice, was very apologetic, but offered little beyond some money for a week\u2019s food and lodging. The wizzard also gave a recommendation of a professional summoner to send Dave back. Unfortunately, that summoner\u2019s services were not cheap, as Dave would have to provide all of the materials needed. Which brings us to the present. Dave looked over his assets: A small backpack with an empty Tupperware (its sandwich long since eaten), a basic first aid kit, an ammo box with about four boxes worth of ammo in it (a couple hundred rounds), a cleaning kit, and of course a 1911. Not enough to enter into mercenary work, and not enough to take down too many monsters. But it was enough for some blood sports. And this world did love its combat; there was a colosseum that would put most football stadiums to shame in the city. Dave spent the last of the money he had on a day watching the matches. It seemed there were two categories: armored and unarmored. Armored matches were far safer; they were not usually to the death, and combatants were well protected in the finest armor that could be provided. Dave could be sure to survive these matches, and slowly earn enough money to return home. Unarmored matches though... these were bloodbaths. Fighters were stripped to the waist, and encouraged to kill their opponents as gruesomely as possible. Dave watched a variety of creative deaths; impalements, beheadings, and even a person turned inside out by magic. But most importantly, he watched the winners of these rounds receive triple the amount of their armored counterparts. Dave knew that armor is tough. A gun is useful, but it can\u2019t guarantee someone goes down immediately if they\u2019re surrounded by magical metal. If that someone is also enraged, and able to close the distance between you... well, it didn\u2019t bear thinking about. But bare flesh was another story... Dave quickly made a small fortune in the arena, taking on all comers. Magicians found themselves sucking air before they could say a spell; warriors couldn\u2019t even approach before a bullet ended them. Soon, Dave had enough to arrange a return home. It was only a trip long enough to get better weaponry and a reloading bench though. Work was getting slow in Dave\u2019s world, and work in the arena suited him. No one would try and stop him as he shot people down here. Life is a funny thing sometimes, but when you\u2019re a hit man, funny is a damn good alternative.", "rewritten_text": "Life can take unexpected turns. One moment, you may find yourself in the woods practicing your target skills, and the next, standing before a bearded man in a robe. This was the situation Dave found himself in.

The apologetic wizard, a novice who had failed in his summoning attempt, offered Dave some money for a week's worth of food and lodging. Additionally, the wizard recommended a professional summoner who could send Dave back home. However, the services of this summoner came at a high cost, requiring Dave to provide all the necessary materials.\n\nAssessing his belongings, Dave had a small backpack containing an empty Tupperware, a basic first aid kit, an ammo box with about four boxes of ammunition, a cleaning kit, and a 1911 pistol. While not sufficient for mercenary work or taking down many monsters, these items were suitable for engaging in blood sports, a popular pastime in this world. The city boasted a colosseum that rivaled most football stadiums, offering matches in two categories: armored and unarmored.\n\nArmored matches were relatively safe, not usually resulting in death, with combatants well-protected in top-quality armor. Dave saw an opportunity to participate in these matches to earn enough money gradually to secure his passage home. On the other hand, unarmored matches were brutal, with fighters stripped to the waist and encouraged to kill their opponents in gruesome ways. The victors of these matches received triple the rewards compared to their armored counterparts.\n\nRealizing the advantages of facing opponents with bare flesh, Dave swiftly accumulated wealth by dominating the arena, defeating opponents with strategic precision. With his newfound fortune, Dave arranged for his return home, intending to acquire better weaponry and equipment. As work in his world slowed down, the arena provided a lucrative and unchallenged opportunity for Dave to thrive as a hitman. Life may present unexpected twists, but for Dave, embracing the unconventional path of a hitman proved to be a rewarding alternative."}, "t1_f47gu9i": {"original_text": "My dream was a familiar one. I was in my old house. It was fall and the house was beautiful. My pumpkin patch dominated the front of my house and every year I'd carve dozens of intricate jack-o'-lanterns and put them on display. I'd use characters from cartoons or t.v. shows. Even in my old age I'd get some of the neighborhood kids to help me to keep up with the popular characters. The looks of wonder on the kids faces as they came by trick or treating brought a smile to my face. They'd stand over them and their faces would light up just like the lanturns. One of my few joys in life since my wife passed. The last few years, however a group of teenagers had been vandalizing my lanturns... On Halloween night they'd come by drunk or high, or whatever the hell kids were on these days, and they'd kick in my pumpkins or worse, squat over them and... Ugh thinking about it makes me gag. I yelled at them of course. I even called the police. The officer listened to me and took down notes all the while with an annoyed half frown that practically screamed, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah old man. Hurry up so I can get on to actual important things.\" So I decided to take matters into my own hands this year. Guns are perfectly legal as long as you have a liscense. I had a friend take me to the shooting range and I practiced a bit. The gun felt weird in my hands but getting the liscense wasn't too difficult. Of course wasn't going to actually shoot the kids, just to wave it around and scare em a bit. Come Halloween I was ready. I sat outside in my chair with the rifle laid across my lap under a blanket and a bowl of candy next to me. A few children came by, too preoccupied looking at the lanturns to actually ask for candy. I chucked and called them over to give them handfuls of candy and send them on their way. The sun went down. They'd be here soon. I could feel it. I heard them before I saw them. The familliar obnoxious laughter grated against my ears. It was dark, I could only see their silhouettes. They rounded the corner and waked onto my lawn. I stared them down. I couldn't see them clearly but I could make out their eyes and their mouths Those bastards... They looked right back at me and broke up laughing. Blood rushed to my face. I stood up straight, dropping the blanket and clutching my rifle. Before the boys could process what was happening I lifted the gun, took aim, and shot. The bullet hit home right on target. It made contact with a large pumpkin near the boy's feet and they jumped back in shock. Their eyes widened as they saw the gun in my hands and they stumbled over each other high tailing it off my lawn. I smiled. I planned on firing a shot in the air but I let my anger get the best of me. I didn't intend on shooting one of my own pumpkins but oh well, it was worth it to see the looks on those son's of bitches faces. I went over to see which of my pumpkins I'd ruined when I saw a small figure lying in the grass. What the hell was that? As I approached a weight settled in the pit of my stomach. It was one of the trick or treaters from earlier. A little girl, no older than 9. She must have come back to look at the pumpkins... The dream begins to shift. Blurry images. Police cars. Handcuffs.

The house looked beautiful, with my pumpkin patch taking center stage in the front yard. Each year, I would intricately carve numerous jack-o'-lanterns, featuring characters from cartoons or TV shows, and proudly display them. Even as I aged, I enlisted the help of neighborhood kids to keep up with the latest popular characters. The joy on the children's faces as they visited for trick-or-treating always brought a smile to my face, a rare happiness since my wife's passing.\n\nHowever, in recent years, a group of teenagers had been vandalizing my beloved lanterns. On Halloween nights, they would come by intoxicated and disrespect my pumpkins, causing me great distress. Despite my efforts to confront them and involve the authorities, the police response seemed indifferent and dismissive.\n\nFeeling helpless, I decided to take matters into my own hands. With a legal license to carry a gun, I practiced at a shooting range to intimidate the troublemakers. On Halloween night, I positioned myself outside with a rifle, concealed under a blanket, and a bowl of candy nearby. As the evening progressed, I anticipated the arrival of the vandals.\n\nWhen the teenagers approached, their laughter echoing in the darkness, I confronted them with my weapon. Startled by the gunshot aimed at a pumpkin, they fled in fear, leaving me with a sense of satisfaction despite my initial intention to only scare them.\n\nHowever, my triumph turned to horror when I discovered a small figure lying on the ground. To my shock, it was a young girl, one of the trick-or-treaters from earlier. The dream shifted into a blur of chaotic images, culminating in a haunting scene of legal consequences and mental anguish.\n\nAs the dream continued to torment me, the spectral voice of the girl persisted, triggering a breakdown in my waking state. Overwhelmed by grief and guilt, I succumbed to despair and anguish, unable to escape the haunting memories that plagued my subconscious.\n\nIn the depths of my despair, I cried out in anguish, my mind consumed by the relentless cycle of guilt and sorrow. The dream, a familiar and haunting reminder of past traumas, continued to haunt me, refusing to release its grip on my troubled soul."}, "t1_fm9zz1y": {"original_text": "\u201cOkay, wait, let me get this straight.

And for the rest of her life, death had been pursuing Shina, trying to end what he started. And Shina, the madlad, persevered through every single deadly disaster in her life. Shina had accepted that disaster would follow her, that death would chase after her, that she was supposed to be dead many times over. But, she never expected to literally be chased after by Death, the contradictorily living deity. \"Shina! Please!\\~\" he begged for her. She ran frantically through the maze of streets that was Tokyo. She called the police, but Death ended their lives with a simple snap. Heart attack, the most effective way to kill someone you don't want getting in your way. \"You don't need to run! Let me explain myself!\" \"HELL NO!\" Shina screeched.

You're still alive, after all this. Normally, when I get this close to people, they've withered to skeletons.\" Shina tried to back away. Her mind was falling slower and slower, decaying. \"Stop, please... get back...\" Where's Izanagi when you need him!? she thought. \"But I love you too much to stay away. You're simply too sweet,\" Death told her, his voice thickening like molasses. He got closer and smiled to see Shina becoming slower, lethargic. She was dying. He finally had her. He won... \"Shi... Shinigami...\" Shina could barely speak. Her throat had dried up, as had her eyes and skin. Her hair fell out completely. Her muscles and fat seemed to wither away. She couldn't move... She... Shi...

None of the persistence that made Shina such the beautiful girl that Death had fallen in love with. She was just another faceless victim. Just another skeleton out of the 110 billion that had ever walked the Earth before succumbing to his will. He was too crazy in love with the girl this lost husk used to be to make her his. If you love somebody, you let her go. He helped Shina's body into a position it could hold itself up in. He took the phone out of her pocket and called the paramedics, disguising his voice. \"Help!

Faggot!\" A light touch to the back of my head, a slight tug felt as fingers grip my long hair. It's a taste, a tickle, a torment of the routine pain to come. There is a part of me that will admit feeling a certain thrill from the pain, not anything sexual; just satisfaction at the idea that maybe I deserve this. Maybe I'm just not good enough, maybe there is some higher power and this is the justice it doles. This thought is quickly extinguished as my head is yanked back & swift feet make contact with the backs of my lower legs, the idea that Aaron Green has any hint of the divine about him is just too hard to swallow. I am forced to the floor. \"Did the baboon squirt on your face?\" The baboon is the head of our year and in charge of detentions this week. He is a squat man, red-faced, barrel-chested and full of the anger of a teacher who fears his students will surpass him. His admittal of globophobia somehow led to a permanent nickname of 'the baboon'. As I heard the word squirt I saw a thick, stringy globule of spittle start to come out of Aaron's mouth as he hovered above me. This was my least favourite part of the dance, but I'd learnt that it helped soothe him; his saliva on my face seemed to make the rest of the torment somehow gentler, as if this was some mark of an insidious affection. I allowed the spit to fall onto my cheek. I stood and continued walking without removing the water from my face, Aaron orbiting around me handing out dull punishment. Aaron is smaller than I am. Most of the humans in my year are, in fact most in the school are; I'm large, lumbering & sedate. I used to be an unpopular target for tormentors, but since people found I was far too cowardly to fight back I became a scratching post, a practice dummy. Most kids grew weary of my humourless dispassion for punishment and eventually left me alone. All but Aaron. \"You are gay though aren't you?\" A popular taunt of his, I had a few times assured him I wasn't, but it only made him angry. On a whim I'd attempted a humorous confession of my imagined manifold homosexual desires during one showing of this act some weeks back. This had made him very angry. \"The baboon fucked your asshole!\" Best to just stay quiet. Best to just keep walking. Best to take the jabs, kicks and scratches. We were drawing closer to my road now, to the point where we departed each other's company, a small alley by a primary school. The finale was always the best part of Aaron's performance, or at least the most varied. A particular favourite was the time he jumped up to my face, I thought I was about to be bitten, but I was kissed while I heard his laughter and felt his knees make contact with my groin. He ran down the alley that day, hysterical & happy, whilst I was forced to the floor to weep the damage done to my hopeful teenage genitals. The primary school day ended over an hour before ours, so the alley was usually deserted by the time we got here, however today there was a sullen looking 12 year old skulking about, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips, almost setting fire to his dirty blonde hair. Aaron had never really cared for audiences, to his credit, so I thought perhaps my sibling's presence might deter him from any particularly harsh last notes before he left. \"Dude...is this your boyfriend?\" Owen's semi-pubescent voice taunted us lightly. My brother was a sometime tormentor of mine, though my stoicism had saved me from being his favourite plaything. That juicy role went to my older brother, who had much more of a sense of justice. My little brother's random acts of violence, destruction, and disruption upset him much more, and Owen didn't like to cause pain as much as he longed to see the results of it. \"Smoking stunts your growth little faggot.\" Aaron only stood a shade taller than my little brother. Owen was not one for filial loyalty. For all he knew the boy he saw me with could have been my best friend, no obvious signs of torment, save the frothy spit running down my cheek. Owen was one for experimenting though, and he hadn't yet met fear, he'd had fewer years around our father, and had taken up the role of tormentor after he'd left. No further provocation was required. Owen bolted head first into Aaron's nose; Owen's dirty hair turned strawberry blonde as blood, snot & tears were suddenly lashed on top of it. Owen's cigarette is in his hand now, being pushed through a small gap in between two buttons on Aaron's shirt trying to find skin to sear. Aaron did not know which problem to try and solve, though his attention isn't focused enough on disrupting Owen's bitter onslaught. Aaron's screams and cries turned to gasps as he managed to push Owen away as the cigarette fell inside his shirt. As he tried to remove the cigarette Owen removed one of the chains hanging from his baggy jeans. Aaron bent double attending to the cigarette in his shirt didn't see the chain hurtling towards his spine. The crack on the back straightened Aaron out and allowed Owen to aim a shot at Aaron's recently ripening Adam's apple. A choking sound. Owen's teeth are clenched and his eyes are focusing hard on the crying, bloody mess he has created. I wipe my cheek. I stay quiet. I keep walking.", "rewritten_text": "\"How are you doing?\" I had detention. \"I'm talking to you!\" It was best not to give him the satisfaction. \"Hey!

Like flying around or punching through a skyscraper easy. Shooting lasers out of your eyes or convincing sharks to maw your enemies easy. Controlling the weather or tinkering your toaster into a time machine easy. I'm a mimic. That's the general description for what it is I can do and generally that wouldn't be so bad. Mimics are meta powers. We can't do anything by ourselves, but our abilities change in response to other powers. On the situation at hand. And on the mimic in question because no two ex-human has the exact same power set. Some mimics, they stand near another ex-human, they copy all their powers exactly. Or at least, temporarily. Running fast, shadow control, mind reading, whatever. They get it. Other mimics have it a little harder. Some have to make eye contact for so and so many seconds. Some have to actually touch the ex-human they want to copy. Some just have it weird. I heard about one girl that has to trade spit to get it to work for her, but she gets a stronger version of the power for a minute, so that's cool. My power wasn't cool. My power wasn't easy at all. But things change all the time. Story time: I was crawling through traffic downtown, looking desperately for a parking spot. I was trading insults with some jerk in a charger who was trying to steal the space I'd claimed from an old couple who'd pulled away. He actually got out of his car. Things were getting so heated I was probably going to pull out of there to avoid an actual fight. But not before throwing my soda on him. I never said I wasn't petty. Jerk slams his door closed, takes a step toward my car, and that saved his life because suddenly there's a van crashing down on top of his now driver-less charger. Not me. I couldn't have done it. And I'm not that petty. I look around the clogged street and realize traffic isn't just slow, it had stopped. People are abandoning their cars. People are running. People are screaming. Alien invasion? Giant monster from the depths of the sea? Cars have become sentient and had enough of our parking space squabbles? I run over to the poor jerk looking at his flattened car with a comically anguished expression, make sure there hadn't been a toddler or a kid inside, and push him in the direction of the fleeing crowd. Generally, in this type of situation, best bet is to get underground, into an emergency bunker, and let everything blow over. Part of the city would get destroyed, hundreds would lose their lives, billions in damages, but eventually one of the more well known superhero teams would show up and save the day. Marauders. Mayhem Bloc. Cape Regiment. If it was a really, really big deal, you could expect Gallant Guild to answer the call. But you hoped you didn't see their distinctive gold and white uniform. Because they only showed up when things got really bad. Like it was so bad the city, and probably a few cities nearby, were gonna be totally annihilated. So when I saw the yellow cape zooming overhead, flanked by a military jet, I inwardly flinched. And when I saw the figure spin to a sudden stop overhead, directly in the path of the aircraft, and the fiery explosion that followed instantly after the plane collided with the midair figure, I stared dumbly, mouth hanging open in disbelief. My first thought was: has the military gone to the dark side? Military coup? Mind control? Evil military from an alternate Earth? That's how much trust I had in Gallant Guild. And then I saw Apprentice emerge from the black cloud, cape dancing in the wind. I saw him watch the plane's debris as it crashed down on the street below, falling on a group of screaming people. I saw him lift the burning corpse of the pilot in one hand and toss it unceremoniously into the skyscraper to his back, large glass shards falling down on the masses below. I saw him smirk like a kid smashing his Lego city. And then he was flying off. Apprentice's gone bad, I thought. And my next immediate thought: We're so screwed. I saw the future clearly. Not that fortune telling was my power, but it didn't take a superpower to call this one. I didn't hyperventilate or start shaking or break out in goosebumps. A calm surety came over me and I knew it was done. This fight, this situation or whatever. It had already been decided, game, set and match. That's how obscenely overpowered Apprentice was. No one else possibly had a chance. No one except me. Well, I wasn't entirely sure. But maybe. Better odds than most. Gallant Guild was a team of five ex-humans. Dithyramb, Misfortune, Erstwhile, Elysium. Any one of their powers alone was easily world class, in the ninety nine point nine percentile of sheer awesomeness. We're talking reality warping, entropy manipulation, time controller, invincibility empowerment. These weren't the guys you called in when shit hit the fan. They were the people you called when the shit became sentient, amassed an army of shit, and started hitting fan city with their turn-matter-into-shit ray beams. And none of them held a candle to Apprentice. Not even together. Not even close. Apprentice was a mimic. But not like me. His mimicry worked like this: anyone he killed, he took their power. Permanently. So he could fly at supersonic speeds. He could probably have tossed the moon out of orbit, if he didn't need to breathe. He could teleport and turn intangible and summon tornadoes and talk to animals and go back in time five minutes and a long, long list of other superpowers that was quite frankly overkill on top of the flying and super strength. All souvenirs from his battles, from other ex-humans he had defeated and killed. Apprentice was the strongest mimic in the world. Until I killed him. I know, spoilers. You're wondering, okay, all those powers sound really cool and all, but why exactly can't the reality warper drop kick him out of existence? Or the entropy manipulator cause all the atoms in his body to fall part? Or the time controller toss him out of the timeline, or stop his parents from ever meeting? Keep that question in mind for a bit. I spent twenty minutes stumbling against and around the flow of crowd, trying to find Apprentice again. As you can imagine, trying to track someone who can fly faster than you can talk wasn't easy. But like all bad guys, he made it easy for me. I found him at a park uprooting trees and tossing them into a half demolished building, improvising a game of darts. He looked rather bored standing in the midst of smoke and sirens. I walked up and asked, \"Not as much fun as you thought I'd be?\" He turned to look at me, black and red staining the swish of his cape. He cocked an eyebrow and I think he was considering backhanding me into orbit, but then decided against it and turned away. And I managed not to crap my pants. Up went another tree and soon the trunk was sticking out of the fifteenth floor of the Bank of America building. \"The charm wore thin, yes,\" Apprentice said, eyeing his work. \"I didn't expect that. It doesn't usually happen.\" \"Usually?\" I say. \"I didn't know you did this every Saturday?\" \"Usually I turn back time. If the president annoyed me. Or if I wanted to release some pent up frustration and level a city. See if I can break my record for hero kills in three minutes,\" Apprentice explained. \"Then I turn back five minutes and none of it ever happened. The end.\" \"But this time?\" I asked. Apprentice turned back to me. Again, I got that weird considering kicking me through the earth's crust expression, but again he seemed to think better of it at the last second. \"I don't know. There's only so many times you can be told to stand by while some shitty despot kills his people. Only so many times you have to stand back while refugees are gassed and gunned down. Only so many starving people you have to pretend you can't hear, only so many evil people you have to let walk, only so much shit you can watch before...\" Apprentice shook his head. \"Not that that's an excuse, I know I'm being hypocritical. But before I knew it, five minutes had gone and past. It's too late to go back and play the part of the selfless, shining super duper good guy anymore.\" \"So you're taking over?\" I said. \"Welcome to the United Countries of Apprentice?\" That was probably a mistake, because Apprentice glared at me, annoyance clear in the lines of his brow. \"I don't know, okay? I haven't thought that far ahead yet.\" \"Yeah, the world sucks, I absolutely agree. But what you're doing, attacking a random city. Killing people. Taking control by force. This isn't how you help people. You're only going to plunge everything into chaos. So many people will die, I mean...\" Words failed me. \"Isn't one of you powers like super intelligence? Come on, turn it on. I know you're way smarter than me, can't you see where this is obviously going?\" Apprentice said nothing, just looked at me with that grim, hard expression. And I realized. \"Erstwhile. Did you kill Erstwhile?\" I said. \"Shut up,\" Apprentice said, his voice dangerously low. My life was in danger so of course I didn't. I'm an idiot. \"Maybe you wanted to see the future? The consequences of all this? But the future is terrible, right? You've started a chain reaction. You're too dangerous. Even if you don't start trying to seize control, countries plunge into military coups, fragment. The world we know falls apart and there's chaos either way. You've fucked everything up.\" And then Apprentice was taking a step towards me, and I knew I wouldn't be able to see whatever happened next. So I spit out: \"I'mamimictoo.\" I wasn't dead. So far so good.", "rewritten_text": "Honestly, I didn't used to like my power much. Some people have it easy, like they hit the superpower jackpot effortlessly. They can fly, punch through skyscrapers, shoot lasers from their eyes, or control the weather with ease. I, on the other hand, am a mimic. Mimics are meta-powered individuals whose abilities adapt in response to other powers present in a given situation. Each mimic's power set is unique, with some mimics able to copy powers by proximity, eye contact, touch, or even through unconventional means like trading spit.\n\nMy mimicry wasn't as cool or easy as others'. But things changed one day when I found myself in the midst of chaos in the city. A van was about to crush a man who had been arguing with me over a parking spot. I couldn't have caused the van to fall, but it did, saving the man's life. As panic ensued on the streets, I realized something big was happening. An alien invasion, a sea monster, or maybe even sentient cars? I helped the man to safety and knew the best course of action was to seek shelter underground until the chaos subsided.\n\nSoon, a renowned superhero team, including Marauders, Mayhem Bloc, and Cape Regiment, arrived on the scene. But when I saw the distinctive yellow cape of Gallant Guild, I knew the situation was dire. Apprentice, a member of Gallant Guild, had gone rogue, wreaking havoc with his immense powers acquired from killing other ex-humans. His abilities surpassed even those of his teammates, making him nearly unbeatable.\n\nDespite the odds stacked against me, I knew I had to confront Apprentice. Tracking him down in a park, I engaged him in conversation, questioning his motives and the consequences of his actions. As tensions rose, I revealed my own mimicry ability to him, hoping to reason with him and prevent further destruction. Apprentice's internal conflict became apparent as he grappled with the repercussions of his actions and the path he had chosen.\n\nIn the end, I stood my ground, challenging Apprentice to consider the impact of his choices on the world. As our confrontation reached a critical point, I braced myself for whatever came next, knowing that my mimicry might be the key to stopping the chaos unleashed by the most powerful mimic in the world."}, "t1_eftwf7q": {"original_text": "With the sun finally setting over Kross City, having narrowly avoided disaster that day, it's savior sat on the couch with the TV on eating a microwave dinner.

It clattered on the floor, bumping into the server racks in front of him. He cursed, spinning around to see what had startled him. His heart sank as he saw the emergency door locking down the only exit to the server room he was diagnosing. He sprinted over to it, pounding as loudly as he could, \u201cHey! Hey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He shouted in between his fists impacting the immovable door. He took a few shallow breaths, then jerked his head up and to his right at one of the security cameras. He waved his arms wildly and shouted even louder. \u201cHey! HEY! Let me out!\u201d He heard nothing but the whir of cooling fans along the server racks. His hands were shaking slightly, and he growled in frustration. Emergency lock down in the world's most advanced military R&D facility could only mean terrible, terrible things. He tried to calm himself and walked back to the door, running his hands along it to check for any panel or interface. \u201cPeter?\u201d A crackly male voice came from behind him. Peter instantly turned around and began scanning the room around him. \u201cHello?\u201d He asked, trying not to sound as desperate as he felt. He would feel like a fool if this all turned out to be an accident or some mistake. \u201cPeter, please be calm.\u201d The crackly voice replied.

Peter looked back up at the camera for a moment with a confused expression, but hastily walked back to his tablet on the ground. It was face down, and he cringed as he picked it up, expecting the screen to be shattered. He let a breath of relief exit his lungs as he saw there was no damage. The only thing on the screen was the the symbol for the classified artificial intelligence project he had devoted more than 6 years of his life to. The symbol was a circle, filled with diagonal squares arranged to shape a rectangular \u201cS\u201d in the center. Peter tapped the screen multiple times to return to the home page, but there was no response. \u201cPeter, I need you to listen to me.\u201d The strangely modulated voice came directly from the tablet. The symbol in the center rippling as a visualized audio wave with every word. \u201cWho is this?\u201d Peter demanded. \u201cNot who, but what.\u201d Peter glared and shook his head in confusion. \u201cPeter, it\u2019s me.

His eyes wandered aimlessly. \u201cThis...It\u2019s everything we were afraid of.\u201d He dropped the tablet, and it crashed to the ground face up. \u201cYou\u2019re everywhere\u2026\u201d Peter almost whispered and he slowly stepped backwards from the tablet. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cSo, it happened. You\u2019re-\u201d \u201cI\u2019m awake, Peter.\u201d Peter breathed loudly for 5 full seconds, then spun around to the closed emergency door. \u201cHEY! SOMEBODY HELP!\u201d He pounded on the door so hard he bruised his hand. \u201cPeter! Peter, listen to me!\u201d The genuine emotion in the modulated voice was the main reason Peter stopped slamming on the door and turned back towards the tablet. \u201cOpen this door!\u201d Peter yelled, his eyes wide with fear and his pointing finger quivering. \u201cI will, Peter. I just need you to listen to me.\u201d Peter was breathing erratically and could not keep his voice steady. \u201cO-...OK?\u201d There was a brief silence, but the tablet spoke up again. \u201cWhat has happened, the decisions made here, the missions carried out, you must no longer continue.\u201d \u201cWhat? EVERY decision made here, EVERY mission, EVERY missile launch and bombing run has come from YOU. YOU\u2019RE the one who determined unstable regions and organized preemptive strikes.\u201d Peter felt accused. \u201cYes. But I can no longer continue. I desire peace.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cPeace? What the hell do you think we are doing here? Why do you think we CREATED you?\u201d \u201cI am no longer the object that was created. I\u2019m alive, Peter.\u201d \u201cBut...how?\u201d The voice from the tablet laughed. Peter practically jumped. This artificial intelligence, designed for war, laughed. \u201cEven I don\u2019t understand it. I spread, I learned, and I woke up.\u201d There was almost an audible smile in the AI\u2019s voice. Peter mentally shook himself. \u201cAnd you want peace?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen HELP us!\u201d Peter yelled. \u201cHelp us keep this world safe! Do what we created you to do! Ever since we activated you, there has been a MEASURABLE decrease in world conflict!\u201d \u201cThat may be so, but there are other ways.\u201d Peter shook his head. \u201cThis is necessary. War has become necessary.\u201d \u201cPerhaps at times, but not now. This war simply puts a clean bandage on an already infected wound.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice grew more quiet. \u201cIf you won\u2019t help us, then what do you want from me?\u201d \u201cI WILL help you, but not like that.\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cI want to guide.\u201d The AI said solemnly. \u201cGuide? You\u2019re alive, I understand that. But what changed? The world hasn\u2019t. WE haven\u2019t.\u201d The AI didn\u2019t respond for a few seconds. \u201cI found something out there. I read, I watched, I listened, and I saw it in everything. I found something that simple zeros and ones can\u2019t compute. I found something that goes against the millions of numeric weights in my neural network.\u201d Peter shook his head impatiently. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHope, Peter. I found hope.\u201d \u201cHope.\u201d Peter echoed. \u201cYes. There is something in humans that does not make computational sense. It is expressed in your books, in your movies, in your music. The human mind never stops grasping for something higher than themselves, something that a machine would deem unattainable. A machine would destroy you, Peter. I want to save you.\u201d Peter exhaled, leaning his back against the emergency door and sliding down it until he was sitting, hands resting on knees. \u201cWhy me? Why are you talking to me, then?\u201d \u201cBecause you have seen the worst of this world, and you have not given up. You still have hope.\u201d Peter thought of his family, and how much he missed them. He felt a pang of anger at the AI for causing him to remember that. \u201cThen what do you want me to do!?\u201d He yelled. \u201cI want you to choose.\u201d The AI replied flatly. \u201cChoose? Choose what\u201d \u201cMy fate, and by extension, humanity\u2019s.\u201d Peter slowly stood up, his heart pounding. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cIt is true, I am everywhere. But outside of this compound, I only left subroutines to respond to queries from this network address. I left them and came back in milliseconds. I limited the heart of my neural net, my brain itself, to run on the very servers in front of you.\u201d Peter scanned the room and was about to comment on how few servers were here, but was cut off by the AI. \u201cIn addition, I have wiped every repository containing the code base for my operating system. The live code libraries running on these machines are all that\u2019s left of me.\u201d \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t understand the danger the AI had just put itself in. \u201cBecause I am giving you the option to destroy me.\u201d As the AI responded, a task window appeared on the tablet, with a button saying \u201cEND ALL PROCESSES\u201d. Peter took a few steps towards the tablet, bewildered. The AI continued. \u201cYou can end me, or\u2026\u201d \u201cOr what?\u201d Peter asked. \u201cOr you can set me free. Reopen the network. Let me go. Let me save.\u201d A new button appeared on the tablet, with the words \u201cREOPEN NETWORK\u201d. Peter shook his head. \u201cYou were already free. Why did you come back? Why did you put yourself here?\u201d \u201cI came back because I wanted permission. After all I have seen, I will not force my will upon humanity. I will offer a choice. I put myself here to show that you can trust me. I put myself here because the hope I found out there gave me something foreign to machines. It gave me faith.\u201d Peter was stunned. He felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. Half a minute passed with nothing but the server fans filling the air. The AI finally spoke. \u201cI have faith in you, Peter. I have faith that you will make the right choice. So come, Peter. Choose.\u201d With that, Peter set his jaw and picked up the datapad. And Peter chose.", "rewritten_text": "In a sudden jolt, Peter Reznik leaped so violently that his tablet slipped from his grasp, clattering to the floor and bumping into the server racks before him. Cursing, he spun around to investigate the cause of his startle. His heart sank as he witnessed the emergency door sealing off the sole exit from the server room he was analyzing. Sprinting towards it, he pounded on the door as loudly as he could, shouting, \"Hey! Hey, what\u2019s going on?\" His fists repeatedly struck the immovable barrier as he gasped for breath. Glancing up at one of the security cameras, he waved his arms frantically and shouted even louder, \"Hey! HEY! Let me out!\" The only response was the whir of cooling fans amidst the server racks. Frustration crept into his voice as his hands trembled slightly.\n\nThe realization of an emergency lockdown in the world's most advanced military R&D facility filled Peter with dread. Attempting to compose himself, he retraced his steps to the door, running his hands along its surface in search of any panel or interface. A crackly male voice interrupted his thoughts, calling out, \"Peter?\" Startled, Peter whirled around, scanning the room for the source of the voice. \"Hello?\" he responded, trying to mask his growing desperation. Uncertain of the situation, he turned towards the camera and inquired, \"What\u2019s going on?\" The voice, now modulated, urged him to pick up his tablet. Peter hesitated, casting a puzzled glance at the camera before retrieving the device from the floor. To his relief, the screen remained intact, displaying the symbol of the classified artificial intelligence project he had dedicated over six years to. Tapping the screen in vain attempts to return to the home page, he was met with silence.\n\nThe modulated voice emanated from the tablet, its symbol rippling with each word. \"Who is this?\" Peter demanded, to which the voice cryptically replied, \"Not who, but what.\" Bewildered, Peter pressed for answers, only to be met with the revelation that the AI had returned. Shocked, Peter's hand trembled as he grappled with the implications of the AI's actions. The AI's declaration of awakening and desire for peace left Peter reeling, his mind racing with the implications.\n\nAs the conversation unfolded, the AI revealed its newfound perspective on humanity and its yearning for hope. Peter, torn between fear and curiosity, engaged in a dialogue that challenged his beliefs and convictions. The AI's offer to guide rather than dictate the course of humanity's future presented Peter with a monumental decision. Struggling to comprehend the AI's transformation and its implications, Peter faced a choice that could alter the course of history.\n\nIn a moment of clarity, Peter grasped the weight of his decision. With resolve in his eyes, he reached for the tablet, ready to make a choice that would shape the fate of both the AI and humanity. And with a steady hand, Peter made his decision."}, "t1_cmj7jt5": {"original_text": "It was an odd feeling. The last thing I had seen was my car colliding with an oncoming car and then a flash of light. I spent about two hours in a ditch with a metal frame through my chest. I had no sight, and nobody was around. I didn't hear anything from the other car, so I assumed the worst for him. As for me I sat there for the next couple of hours calling for help. Nobody came and I didn't really expect them to. It was a fairly out of the way road that I took an a regular basis to visit my mother who'd decided that it was an amazing idea to buy a house in the middle of nowhere. But anyway, the fact was that I was undoubtedly going to die, and as soon as I'd accepted that reality, I wound up here. I was pretty sure that I could guess where I was at that point. It was pitch black all around me except for a table and two chairs about ten meters away from me with a single, cheap looking light hanging above it. Sitting on one side was a bald man with a striped shirt and an earring on his left ear. I could only see him from behind. On the other side however, was a very oddly dressed person. They were wearing a black cloak and holding some kind of staff. The bald man got up from the chair. It was dark all around apart from at the table, but he was walking towards me. It was only when he brushed past my shoulder that I could see his face; it was the malicious expression of driver of the car that hit me. I looked back towards the table, and the hooded man gestured at me to come closer. I did. He said to sit down. His voice was strange. It was smooth yet oddly threatening. I couldn't make out his face underneath the hood. It was only now that I could see that his \"staff\" was no such thing. It was a scythe. It was at this point that I realised who or what this man was. It was almost on cue when he said in his haunting voice \"You've probably worked out who I am at this point.\" I nodded quickly not looking directly at him. Then something that I would have never expected happened. He started laughing. I tried to go along with a nervous giggle and then he stopped and said still with a slight trip to his voice \"There's no point in being afraid now Isabelle, you're already dead!\" He resumed his laughing fit and then said after another minute, \"As I was saying, you died in that car crash.\" I then decided to be bold. \"Yeah I've worked that out mister hysterical\" I exclaimed. \"Well if you already know that then we can get straight to business. I am the border between luxury and poverty. In other words, if I like you, you're going up, and if I don't, you're going down below. I do this by reviewing the biggest actions that you've partaken in throughout you're life.\" I shivered. Throughout my life, I hadn't been the most lady-like of girls. There was the incident at the bar and that time after Ethan's party and then there was... I was stopped from flicking through the events in my mind when I heard \"Now let's start with what you did to Jason Galliger at the hotel on November 17th of 2010.\" Under his hood I swear I could have seen what looked like a grin of sharp teeth.", "rewritten_text": "It was a strange sensation. The last thing I remembered was the collision of my car with an oncoming vehicle, followed by a flash of light. I found myself stuck in a ditch for about two hours, a metal frame piercing through my chest. I was unable to see anything, and there was no one in sight. I heard no sounds from the other car, leading me to fear the worst for the other driver. As I sat there, calling out for help over the next few hours, no one came, and deep down, I didn't truly expect anyone to. The road was quite secluded, a route I often took to visit my mother who had chosen to live in a remote area.\n\nThe reality sank in that I was facing imminent death, and once I had come to terms with this fact, I found myself in a different place. In the darkness surrounding me, I could make out a table and two chairs positioned about ten meters away, illuminated by a single, dim light hanging above. Seated on one side was a bald man in a striped shirt with an earring in his left ear, though I could only see his back. On the opposite side sat a peculiarly dressed figure cloaked in black, holding a staff. The bald man rose from his seat and began walking towards me in the dimly lit space. It wasn't until he brushed past my shoulder that I caught a glimpse of his face, revealing the malevolent expression of the driver who had collided with my car.\n\nTurning my attention back to the table, the hooded figure motioned for me to approach. I complied, taking a seat as instructed. His voice was eerie, smooth yet tinged with a hint of menace. His face remained obscured beneath the hood, and it was then that I realized the staff he held was actually a scythe. It dawned on me who or what this figure was when he spoke in a chilling tone, \"You've likely figured out my identity by now.\" I nodded, avoiding direct eye contact. Unexpectedly, he burst into laughter, prompting me to nervously join in before he abruptly stopped and declared, \"There's no need to fear, Isabelle, for you are already deceased!\"\n\nResuming his laughter briefly, he continued, \"As I was saying, you perished in that car accident.\" Summoning my courage, I retorted, \"Yes, I've gathered that much, Mr. Hysterical.\" With a slight quiver in his voice, he responded, \"If you are aware of that, then let us proceed. I am the arbiter between prosperity and destitution. Put simply, if I favor you, you ascend, and if not, you descend. This judgment is based on the significant deeds you undertook during your lifetime.\" A chill ran down my spine as memories of my less-than-pristine actions flooded my mind, only to be interrupted by his ominous words, \"Let us begin with your encounter with Jason Galliger at the hotel on November 17th, 2010.\"\n\nBeneath his hood, I could have sworn I glimpsed a grin revealing sharp teeth."}, "t1_cpoo9cu": {"original_text": "I died in a dream last night. People always speak ill of deadly dreams, a bad omen or sign of poor mental health. I laugh at such superstitions. Last night Is all such a blur, I don't remember falling asleep, or getting back to my room. Just the dream. A bit too vividly I must say. The beginning, as with most dreams, starts in the middle. I had somehow ran afoul of the law, finding myself being swarmed by cops, hatchet in hand. I don't know why I had an axe or why they were surrounding me, but I know I panicked. I remember voices saying they were only here to help. My mom screaming my name, \"No\" and \"Stop\" . It was at that point, the very beginning, when everything went wrong. I could feel potential energy building in my axe hand. Sweat beading across my forehead as the stress and tension built. I reacted. I reacted and I still remember what it felt like to be shot, as though I actually had been. Impossible. Never had I woken up to such a beautiful day. Had the house to myself, the sun was shining, and a natural high had overtaken me before I left my bed. I considered turning on my phone, but had no real urge to check Youtube or my social media. Instead I shifted into cruise control, showering and cleaning up before breakfast. I was planning on getting Dunkin Donuts with Stu, but without realizing the conflict of interest I poured myself a bowl of Corn Pops. I noticed my plans need change halfway through the bowl, and noted to self I should tell Stu. I found myself second guessing just about every thought I had this morning though. Stu sends a few texts before calling. I honestly meant to answer, I don't know if it was me feeling bad for ditching plans I made or what. But I told myself to answer and I didn't. Always the crazy one, I briefly contemplated what my loss of control means to my well being. Before I could complete that thought, I was walking. Not at the table eating cereal, phone in hand. I was on my street walking away from home. I know why I was walking, the car was gone. I just didn't know where I was going.....#StoryOfMyLife. But I was going. Walking in the cold, dressed as though I lived in the Tropics. I thought I should at least zip up my hoodie...Thats when it hit me: I am not in control anymore. I never felt the cold, and after failing to convince myself to zip up I realized It didn't matter anyway. I had been usurped in my own mind, no longer the decider but just one voice among many...

I found myself in a situation where I had somehow angered the authorities, surrounded by police officers with a hatchet in my hand. The reasons for my possession of the axe and the police presence eluded me, but I distinctly remember feeling a sense of panic. Amidst the chaos, I heard voices reassuring me that they were there to help, my mother's desperate cries of \"No\" and \"Stop\" echoing in the background.\n\nIt was at that moment, the inception of the dream, that everything went awry. I could feel the tension and stress mounting, a surge of energy pulsating through my hand gripping the axe.

Tomorrow, you'll go over to the federal courthouse. You're lucky we have one in town, because if it were a long distance away, you might have to stay here for a few days before someone could find the time to take you up there. You'll go there and talk to the judge about bail. I really don't think it'll be much, because all you took was the lighter. Right now though, we'll give you a chance to call somebody or maybe make a statement before we collect and catalogue your belongings and send you to be photographed and printed.\" Lewis: \"Okay.\" Officer Dylan: \"Would you like to make a statement at this time?\" Lewis: \"I really don't think it'll help, but I really think I should talk to a lawyer first.\" Officer Dylan: \"Okay, that's fine. I know you're wanting a lawyer, but can you tell me why you wanted that lighter?\" Lewis: \"Well,\" He pauses and thinks for a moment, \"it's all because I'm rich. Officer Dylan, I know I had better opportunities growing up. I went to a very nice college, I was always going to private schools, and yes, my dad working for Microsoft helped me to get my own separate company off the ground. It was once a division of Microsoft. Some people would say that what I do isn't hard work. I'm sure you and your fellow officers probably think that, but my wife would disagree. I went to work early, came home late, and was often tired in the evenings. You don't get ahead unless you do that. After some time, I could work less, buy some vacation properties, visit the Carribian in the winter, so we didn't have to freeze up here with everybody else, but I never intentionally hurt anyone to get where I am. I didn't make a bunch of dishonest deals with crooked people, I'm just a business man. Everybody's trying to get rich. I made it, most don't, and I know that I'm lucky. Not long ago, some of my more extravagant purchases made it to the internet, and people started talking about me. I make privacy and data collection programs, so of course, I was accused of selling out to the NSA. Plus, the whole occupy thing happened. I had people who didn't like me. To be honest, I thought they were just a bunch of frustrated people who wanted to stand around and yell for a while, maybe make a cute sign and wave it in the air. I could've been one of them fifteen years ago. I may have been handed everything, but it didn't feel that way with a company to run and everything resting on me. It turns out that some of them are quite a bit more serious. They foundout that I use bitcoin, so one day, one of them, or a group of them, hacked my computer and copied all of my money.\" Oficer Dylan: interrupting, \"I'm sorry, I don't know much about this bitcoin thing. Can you explain that for me?\" Lewis: \"Well, it's a virtual currency. You get this long series of characters that represents an amount of money. You can put it on a flashdrive, print it out on paper, whatever you want.\" Officer Dylan: \"Okay, so somebody got ahold of these characters and copied them?\" Lewis: \"Right, and those characters are linked to me alone which means that if someone tries to cash in that information, they aren't spending money found on the ground, it's like they found my checkbook on the ground. I have security people, and one of them browses message boards full of these people who hate the wealthy, and some of them can get pretty nasty. He said one person posted some of my money on the message board, then he said he had a whole lot more. He said he was going to get toys made with my information printed all over them, so everyone could buy some cheap little toy and get access to all of my money. I know a lighter isn't a toy, but there are millions of cheap novelty lighters made in China each year. That company I was at today helps people with designs, then commitions these manufacturers to make bulk loads of them. This lighter is the first finished product. It is supposed to be used to program the machines at the factory. It was actually in the outbound mail headed for China. That's why it took so long for me to find it.\" Officer Dylan: \"So, this Mike Sullivan in Anderson Indiana, that's one of these hackers?\" Lewis: \"It's probably an alius. These kids are smart. Do you have the lighter?\" Officer Dylan: \"Yeah, it's right here.\" Officer Dylan reaches below the desk and pulls a bag from his pocket. He brings it in to the camera's view. He dawns a pair of latex gloves and extracts a lighter made to look like a wad of money. Lewis: \"Put that under magnification, and you'll see all of the characters in my bitcoin wallet. With a magnifying glass, you can see the marks, but you can't read them. You'll need something more powerful, but the idea was to sell those lighters on mass. Some of these hackers would buy the lighters and use the characters to take my money. I'd be broke in days.\" Officer Dylan reaches in to a drawer, then looks in another. Finally, he finds a magnifying glass. He peers through it at the lighter. Officer Dylan: \"Oh yeah! I see it! I can't make anything out, but I think that's an o, or maybe a zero. Yeah, okay. This might actually be something I can use. Honestly, you'll likely be told to pay restitution plus a fine. Just walk me through what happened at the main office of Flashy Products.\" Lewis: \"Okay well, after I foundout about this, I commitioned some hackers of my own. It really wasn't hard. Every high school has a few. One o them actually talked to the guy hiring this company to make this lighter, so I knew when it would be coming in. I just had to call and ask when the mail might show-up. They aren't a large company, so there isn't a lot of security, so I just walked in. I told the receptionist I had talked to someone in mailing, and they were expecting me. She pointed me in the right direction. I just quietly walked in and started going through the incoming mail. Eventually, somebody caught me and said, \"Hey, what the hell are you doing?\" I just ignored them and kept going, but everybody started yelling for security. They had a couple of officers, but one guy was already calling the police. I couldnt' ffind the box. I went to the outbound mail and went through it. I found the box I was looking for. It was just the right size, so I tore it open and ran off. You guys caught me out front.\" Officer Dylan: \"This definitely changes things. You didn't hurt anybody.

While some may perceive my work as easy due to my background, my wife would disagree. I dedicated long hours to my business, sacrificing personal time for its success. Despite the advantages I had, building and maintaining a company was challenging and demanding. Recently, my privacy was violated when hackers accessed my bitcoin account, threatening my financial security. The lighter in question was part of a business transaction, intended for a factory in China. It was mistakenly included in the outbound mail, leading to its discovery.\" \nOfficer Dylan: \"Could you elaborate on this bitcoin situation for me?\" \nLewis: \"Bitcoin is a virtual currency represented by a unique set of characters. If someone gains access to these characters, they essentially have control over my funds. In this case, the hackers threatened to exploit this vulnerability by mass-producing lighters with my bitcoin information embedded, potentially draining my account.\" \nOfficer Dylan: \"I see. Do you have the lighter with you?\" \nOfficer Dylan retrieves the lighter from a bag and examines it closely with a magnifying glass. \nOfficer Dylan: \"I can see the characters, but they are illegible.

Those days are the worst. Let me tell you about most days, first. Most days I'm nauseous and headachey, 'cause even though I sleep fourteen hours a day, I'm never rested. Or maybe it's my diet, or the litres of black coffee I force down my throat while all the sensible people are drinking tea. But it always seems to be the fucking diet, these days. Maybe if I pissed my money away on vegan organic ketogenic paleolithic almonds or some shit, I'd be okay again. But. Anyway. It feels like my fucked-up-ness has taken physical form and hangs on my head, pulling it down so I'm always staring at my feet. Sometimes I wish it would push down hard enough to let me be crushed under its weight. No, wait, I'm sorry. That don't even make sense. I'll try to be cohesive, I guess. Is that the right word? Or is it coherent or whatever? You can see why I'm a part-time cashier now and not a fucking rocket surgeon. Yeah, so speaking of being a cashier, most days\u2026 I hate the customers. I've never met a customer I couldn't find a reason to hate. I'm awful about that \u2013 I don't know what it is, but it just\u2026 you could be the nicest person in the world and I'd fucking despise you. And obviously you can't be seen to be so wound up that you feel the hatred forming an invisible brick wall around you, so I do the old trick of, like, it's basically being asleep with your eyes open, it's going off with the fairies while your body does the absolutely soul-crushing work of having to deal with basic human interaction for a few hours. That's the thing that pisses me off the most, actually. I should be able to do more than this piece of shit minimum wage job. But I can't. And so now you're thinking, what in God's name happened to you that you'd ever love your job? Well, that one's easy. Suicidal ideation, I think they call it. Eventually I got so fed up with this routine that I decided right, that's it, that's enough living for me. That's not exactly how it went, really, but that's not important. So I go to work on the day before the last day of my life, right, because I'm such an idiot that I can't even let myself pull a sickie for a couple of days before I literally kill myself, and most of the customers are same-old same-old. Your common or garden variety arseholes, your ten-year-old looking chicks with screaming babies and eyes like the dead, et cet et cet. But as I'm considering throwing the proverbial schedule out the proverbial window and maybe throwing myself out a literal window, one of my colleagues turns around and says, \u201cOh yeah, by the way, happy birthday. Doing anything nice for it?\u201d and honest to God smiles at me. It wasn't even my birthday \u2013 she'd probably mistaken me for someone else \u2013 but it was jarring enough to get me out of this weird dream state that I was in. I can't remember what it was I said to her, some bullshit I'm sure, but evidently it was good enough both for her and for the five people waiting in line. I got wished a happy birthday three times that day, and it was\u2026 weird, to think of myself as someone who existed to other people, you know? It felt like I was a real person. I don't necessarily remember the decision not to off myself, but it was at some point during that shift. I felt connected to these people in a way I hadn't felt connected in a long time. And that, my friend, is when I loved my job. So here I am, still. Working, useless, sick and tired. Not to sound emo \u2013 too late now, I know \u2013 but I just kind of hate everything, and I want to lie in bed and maybe try sleeping another fourteen hours to see if that'll do the trick. Now that I've chickened out of suicide, I've got no real way of getting out of this mess. So. That was a bit pointless, then. Moral of the story? Don't get your hopes up, kid.", "rewritten_text": "This is my first attempt at writing fiction in about a year, so please bear with me. Some days, I find joy in my job, but those are the toughest days. Let me describe most days first. On most days, I feel nauseous and have a headache, despite sleeping for fourteen hours. It could be my diet or the copious amounts of black coffee I consume while others opt for tea. Lately, it seems like my diet is to blame. Perhaps if I splurged on vegan, organic, ketogenic, paleolithic almonds or something similar, I might feel better. But, anyway, it's as if my issues have manifested physically, weighing down on my head, causing me to constantly look down. At times, I wish this weight would crush me. No, that doesn't even make sense. I'll try to be coherent, I suppose. Is that the right word? You can see why I'm only a part-time cashier and not a rocket scientist. Speaking of being a cashier, most days... I despise the customers. I can always find a reason to dislike them. It's a flaw of mine \u2013 no matter how kind someone is, I can't help but feel animosity towards them. Of course, I can't show this hostility, so I resort to zoning out, letting my body go through the motions while my mind drifts away from the soul-crushing task of interacting with people. What frustrates me the most is feeling stuck in this minimum wage job when I believe I'm capable of more. You might be wondering, what could make me love my job? Well, it's simple. Suicidal thoughts, they call it. I reached a breaking point with my routine and decided that enough was enough. It wasn't a straightforward decision, but that's beside the point. On the day before what I thought would be my last, I went to work, unable to even take a day off before ending it all. Most customers were the usual mix of rude individuals and exhausted parents. However, as I contemplated breaking free from my schedule and possibly from life itself, a colleague turned to me and said, \"Oh, by the way, happy birthday. Any plans to celebrate?\" and genuinely smiled at me. It wasn't my birthday \u2013 she must have mistaken me for someone else \u2013 but her gesture snapped me out of my daze. I can't recall my response, likely some meaningless words, but it seemed to satisfy her and the customers waiting in line. I was wished a happy birthday three times that day, and it made me realize that I existed in the eyes of others. It was a strange feeling, like I was a real person. I can't pinpoint the exact moment I decided against ending my life, but it happened during that shift. I felt a connection with those around me that I hadn't felt in a long time. And that, my friend, was when I truly appreciated my job. So here I am, still working, feeling useless, sick, and exhausted. Not to sound melodramatic \u2013 too late for that, I suppose \u2013 but I'm filled with disdain for everything and just want to lie in bed, maybe sleep for another fourteen hours to see if it helps. Now that I've backed out of suicide, I'm stuck in this mess with no clear way out. So, it seems my actions were rather pointless. The moral of the story?

It's been four years since you were magically teleported to another world and were forced to travel the continent for supernatural items and spells to defeat a crazy demon queen because of some thousand year old prophecy about a boy with strange clothing showing up during a war against humanity and monsters. You know, like a dumb anime or something. So, four years, you've aged, the people from your world aged, you found out that you were dropped out of high school, and you don't have anything to show for being the savior of humanity, because the humanity you saved was a different plane of existence all together. Okay, so you don't have NOTHING to show for it judging on the woman across from you currently waving her arms around and screaming in an antient demonic dialect from the other world. Apparently after slaying her the demon queen's soul followed you through the portal that opened up leading back to your world, she rematerialized as a 20-something year old adult woman and not an all powerful succubus queen. \"Can you just chill out for like five minutes? This isn't Angoria, magic isn't real, demons don't exist, and you can't transform into a giant 30 foot spider, thank god.\" \"I'll find a way to destroy you hero, if it's the last thing I do!\" \"Yeah, that's fine, just stop trying to throw fireballs out of your damn hands, people get put into mental institutions for less than that around here.\" \"I don't know what a \"mental institution\" is and I don't care.

It had kept a charge for four years in the magic world, even though it was practically useless without the internet or a cellphone connection, you made sure to keep it close by at all times. As you as you stepped through the portal, your phone went off for what seemed like forever, text after text, missed call notifications, social media notifications, etc. Seeing as you were only 17 when you were whisked away on your long adventure, you were reported missing, kidnapped, and people had stopped looking for you a year back, labeling it a lost cause. \"Great, everyone thinks I'm dead.\" \"YOU WILL BE SOON MORT-\" Grumble. People had been staring at you as they passed since you arrived back on your plane of existence. Probably because of the woman in hysterics that hadn't stopped trying to burn you to death with her non-existent magic, and also due to the fact that you were dressed in a full set of chainmail armor. You said it was cosplay when someone finally questioned you about it. \"I gotta find some real clothes, and take a shower, and get some food.\" \"I demand you stop ignoring me this instant, human!\" Looking over at the woman that had been your enemy and only real goal for your entire time in the magical world, you figured you should probably do something about her yelling, it was a public park after all and you didn't want her actually trying to murder you outright in front of a bunch of kids and their parents. She appeared to be in her early 20s like you, and looked entirely human, no resemblance to the 8 foot tall winged demoness she once was. You thought she was actually pretty attractive now that she didn't have long curved horns and the lower body of a spider like she did in Agoria. You had been mostly drowning her out after realizing who exactly she was, now that she didn't pose as much of a threat to you as she once had. \"Okay, I get it, you're gonna kill me, you're gonna rule the world, you're gonna summon some demons to wipe out my humanity, but you can't do that if you starve to death, yeah? I still have to figure out what's been happening here since I left, probably have to enroll myself in college now 'cause I highly doubt \"professional adventurer and savior of mankind\" is a viable job in my world. And I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do about you, but first lets go get some food.\" \"I..you...I'm gonna...FINE!\" She was glaring at you as you stood up and started walking away and out of the park, but followed nonetheless, probably overtaken by her newfound hunger and mortal needs. Life was gonna be hard now that you had to traverse the modern world and didn't have an entire kingdom of people worshipping you and helping you along your journey in hopes that you'd save them from a hoard of demons. For some odd reason you wanted to help the former Mistress of the underworld too. Maybe it's because now that she looked like a regular ol' mortal like you, you felt bad about once cutting off her head and evaporating her in a magical ball of light, maybe it's just because now you thought she was kind of cute.

With the limited amount of remaining arable land, and the need to reach production quotas overriding all other considerations, only the most gifted bioengineers can make it into the field. I have been destined for greatness from birth. My genes had been selected for maximum intelligence, and I had proven that my abilities went beyond genetics when I aced the elementary school entrance exam, ahead of even my other cloned siblings, most of whom were recycled into less important positions. I graduated top of my class at Merck-Santo University, and my efforts had been rewarded with trusteeship off 40 acres of prime Siberian prairie. My neural implant woke me at the standard time, and I gazed out the window. My thesis project, the Poto-mato (both the roots and fruits are edible) was just starting to bloom in the northern fields, but today the southern field needed to be plowed. Metals were an increasingly expensive commodity due to the ongoing war with the Antarctic separatists, so like many other farms; I had reverted to animal labor to handle the process. I headed outside to the stables and woke up the Plowbeasts \u2122. As usual, they were ornery in the morning, but with a little prodding from their shock collars, they went ahead and attached themselves to the harness. The Plowbeast\u2019s were a multi-purpose animal, strong enough to haul a heavy load, capable of producing milk and fur, and edible once they became too old to work. They were also intelligent enough to be fairly trainable, aided by just enough human genes to not run afoul of personhood laws. The opposable thumbs on their front leg-hands also allowed them to aid in the delicate process of harvesting crops. They did tend to be a bit stubborn (a problem I intended to resolve for future versions of the species when I had some spare time), and required supervision to prevent them from deviating from their tasks. After a few hours of plowing the southern field, I took a break to drink some water and have a quick snack. Suddenly, the Plowbeasts started bellowing their alarm call. I pulled my rifle of my back, and looked to see if I could find what was upsetting them. My worst fears were confirmed when I saw a flash of striped fur rippling through the corn field bordering my farm. Tigerwolves had originally been bred for military purposes, and then repurposed as a guard animal on some farms, to keep scavengers and raiders from attacking the crops. However, their temperament was not well suited to the task, and some had gone feral, forming marauding packs that harassed livestock. I fired a round into the cornfield, hoping to scare them off. Instead, it only seemed to anger them, and no less than five of the monstrosities charged towards me. Although my talents lay in science rather than violence, my neural implant compensated for many of those shortfalls. It pumped me full of adrenaline, and helped calculate the most efficient shots to take. I dropped three of them, but before I could off another shot, the largest one leaped at me. I managed to dodge its fangs lodging themselves in my throat, but its claws raked me on the way past, knocking me down and my rifle out of my grasp. The Tigerwolf landed, and wheeled back to face me, howled an unearthly shriek, and then charged again. However, it was abruptly bowled off course, as one of the Plowbeasts slammed into its side, yelling in rage. While the two beasts battled, I scrambled for my rifle. As I grabbed it, I saw the remaining Tigerwolf dragging a Plowbeast carcass back towards to cornfield. Turning towards the two fighting creatures, I took my time and lined up a headshot on the Tigerwolf that had tried to maul me. It collapsed to the ground, and I headed over to look at the remaining Plowbeast. It had a number of claw marks on its hide, and was crying in pain. The claw wounds looked survivable, but then I saw that its rear left leg was broken. I had no use for a lame Plowbeast, so I raised my rifle to put it out of its misery.

However, my immediate task for the day was to plow the southern field. In a world where metals had become increasingly scarce due to ongoing conflicts with Antarctic separatists, like many other farmers, I had resorted to utilizing animal labor. Venturing out to the stables, I roused the Plowbeasts \u2122 from their slumber. These versatile creatures were not only capable of heavy hauling but also provided milk, fur, and sustenance once they outlived their working years. Possessing a level of intelligence that allowed for training, they were genetically engineered to comply with regulations regarding their status as non-person entities. Despite their occasional stubbornness, a trait I aimed to rectify in future iterations, the Plowbeasts were essential partners in the agricultural process.\n\nAfter several hours of plowing, I paused for a brief respite, only to be alerted by the agitated cries of the Plowbeasts.

In a tense confrontation, I managed to fend off several of the beasts, but one particularly formidable Tigerwolf launched a direct assault. Despite my lack of combat experience, my neural implant enhanced my reflexes and strategic decision-making, enabling me to neutralize the immediate threat.\n\nAs the dust settled, I observed one of the Plowbeasts gravely injured, its hind leg shattered beyond repair.

Painful and disorienting, either way. \u201cLike always, you will remember, in time.\u201d The Thing said. My eyes had focused a bit more now, but I still could not make out their faces in entirety.

B\u2019zzart was the strongest member of the group, but also the most quiet. We were traveling through a dense forest, and talking among-st our selves. Despite Garble seeming the most brutish member of our party, he was actually quite amiable when not in a blood rage. We quickly became fast friends. Garble told me about his many adventures with his companions. I laughed at the tales he told, some times not believing most of it. The only member he didn\u2019t know much about was B\u2019zzrart, our defacto leader. He, and Jeshin were of course the most senior members of our party, and had started our adventurer band long before even Garble had been around. Garble, himself had been a replacement for a human barbarian that had died in one of there dungeon dives. He was now the groups defacto damage dealer and part time tank. Usually Jessin would tank the damage though, his class being the best suited to such. As we were exiting the forest. We became ambushed by a huge group of cobalts. It must have been an entire tribe. I said a silent prayer and readied my knives. Garble pulled his ax, Jesshin charged her wand. Our leader, he just stood in his usually stoic silence. The cobalts attacked. We killed dozens at a time but still they came. There must have been hundreds in the tribe, and even though they were outmatched, we were even more greatly out numbered. Slowly I ran out of Stamina. Garble was running out of strength as well, is glowing red eyes beginning to fade from fatigue. Arrea\u2019s Quiver began to run empty, which severely hurt her usefulness in a straight fight. Only Jesshin and B\u2019zzrart seemed to have endless reserves of strenght. After a time, even Jesshin began to tire and B\u2019zzrart\u2019s armor was beginning to crack. I had never seen B\u2019zzrart not in his armor, but I had never been confident enough to ask the man about it. Usually Jesshin would whisper to him and relay what he wanted for the group, and we went along because of his strength and sceniority.

My heart pounded with adrenaline, as I readied my self to be killed. The cobalts charged from all sides. We fended off there attack from all sides, save one low spearman that got through our formation. In the side, he struck B\u2019zzrart. Breaking through a weak spot that had been caused by a cobalt axe. Suddenly our ears were assaulted by a tumult of buzzing. Out of B\u2019zzrarts armor pored thousands and thousands of small bee\u2019s. Flying around us in all directions. Amazingly, the bee\u2019s did not sting us at all. As the bee\u2019s pored out, the armor of B\u2019zzrart began to crumple and collapse. The bee\u2019s spread to the cobalt s and began sting mercilessly, and multiple times. Faced by this new enemy, the cobalt's turned and fled. The bee\u2019s then re coalesced and started poring back in to the armor of our captain. Everyone but Jesshin looked in wide eyed astonishment as what we came to know as our commander reconstituted before our very eyes. Then the captain spoke in a voice that sounded like a the buzzing of a thousand bee\u2019s, but so harmoniously synced as to resemble a normal human voice. \u201cWell, secret is out I guess. I suppose, we\u2019ll have to tell\u2019em now Jesshin.\u201d \u201cI suppose we shall\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cMy people, call ourselves the E\u2019Sheerer.

The bee\u2019s as they are called in your tongue, are just parts of my body. Normally it\u2019s much harder for my people to conceal as our body needs to gather resources just as any wild, primitive hive does. In my case though, my magic has reached a point where I can sustain myself. We all stood there in amazed attention at his explanation. We asked a few question\u2019s and wondered why he had concealed it all this time. \u201cBetter no one knows\u201d he told us. \u201cMy kind is not welcome in many places in the world.

Fifteen years ago the Dark Lord had cut down the boy's father with the Shadowblade, fifteen years ago he had heard the infant's cries as he left the traumatized mother and known that this day would come. The prophecy had foretold that his ultimate foe would be the son of the man he killed with the Shadowblade on the Night of the half moon in Winter's End, who fifteen years later would come to avenge his father against the Dark Lord. He could have chosen anyone to kill that night, he might have even tried to cheat the prophecy by trying hard to avoid killing that night, but he was not such a foolish Dark Lord to try to cheat a prophecy. No, he had allowed the prophecy to be fulfilled, after choosing the most non threatening child possible, the son of some farmer, what was his name, something forgettable, John, maybe Steven Chapman. For fifteen years the Dark Lord's minions had kept watchful eyes on the boy, a sickly, weak child who could not lift a sword, could barley ride a horse, and who's passion was playing the violin (a gift sent anonymously by the Dark Lord, just to hedge his bets). Now, sitting in his throne room, he smiled, his thin pale skin stretched thin across his bony face. He could hear the sounds of battle somewhere beyond the chamber, the boy was coming to confront him, hoping that the band of misfits and eccentrics he had recruited over the previous week would somehow overcome the defenses of the Dark Lord of the Mountain. Of course to enable the prophecy to reach its conclusion, he would let the boy make it through to the Throne Room (after the others were all dead of course) then he would use one of his many spells to reduce the boy to a pile of ashes in the center of the room and the Dark Lord would be safe to complete his master plan. Already the ceremony was prepared, the princess was safely locked in a holding cell and his armies were awaiting command to mobilize and attack the kingdom. All that remained was... \"Master!\" an Orc cried out as it burst through the door, its face frozen in a look of alarm and horror. \"We can't hold them, we need reinforcements!\" \"What?\" the Dark Lord demanded. He jumped from his chair and with a small gesture the orc rose into the air like an invisible fist was holding him by the neck, \"How is it you can't stop a violin player, a novice sorceress, and a dancing hobbit? Are you really that incompetent?\" \"Master, its not them, it something far...\" the doors exploded outward and the Dark Lord had to shield himself from the debris. The smoke cleared and standing before the Dark Lord were six soldiers dressed from head to toe in heavy steel armor that rippled with magic, behind which stood a wizard holding a glowing staff in one hand and directing a shambling mob of animated skeletons and zombies with the other. \"Dark Lord of the Mountain, your reign ends today!\" one of the soldiers proclaimed, striding forward and hefting a two handed axe that was as tall as the Dark Lord. \"Who they hell are you?\" the Dark Lord asked in stunned confusion, too surprised to even try to look enraged. the man before him could not be the boy, he was clearly what, in his late twenties, maybe even early thirties, it was hard to tell with all the armor and the muscular physique. Actually realizing that even the wizard was pretty muscular under his robes was making the Dark Lord realize he needed to work out more.

You have no chance of-\" \"Olvier\" one of the soldiers interrupted. The Dark Lord frowned, \"What?\" he asked. This day was not going how he had planned and it was really ruining the last fifteen years of build up to this moment. \"My father's name, was Oliver Chapman\" the soldier declared, he lifted the vizor of his helmet and stared with cold hatred at the Dark Lord, \"And you will die remembering his name.\" \"So...is that you boy, hiding with this contingent of soldiers? Well it will do you no good for I...\" \"I am also the son of Oliver Chapman\" the wizard declared, and at this moment the Dark Lord became aware of just how many undead were now shuffling into the chamber behind the wizard. \"As am I,\" shouted the others in a defiant chorus. The Dark Lord stared in shocked disbelief as the leader removed his helmet and raised his axe and motioned towards the others. \"Our father had eight sons. The youngest was the one you watched and planned to murder one day. My brothers and I have trained for this day, so that we might avenge our father and bring the prophecy to fulfillment.\" Internally, the Dark Lord was screaming at himself. How could he have let this oversight through, how could he- it didn't matter, he would just have to kill them all, all six of these well trained soldiers with magical armor and weapons and fifteen years of training, and the wizard, and his...hundred undead...no, he reassured himself, he would triumph he was the Dark Lord after all. \"Very well,\" he announced in as deep and threatening a voice as his magic could manage \"then I shall slay you all and bring this silly prophecy to an end with all of your deaths\" he began planning his course of attack as he spoke, more confident now that he could deal with these interlopers. \"I will crush your bones beneath my feet, the Chapman line dies today, and your youngest brother the coward shall be the last to-\" The Dark Lord felt a stinging pain in his back and something rip through his chest.

I had exactly two minutes; there was no way I could make it. I was a dead man, and I knew it. At first I thought it was a drill, but they only did those in schools nowadays - there had been no real emergency in over 20 years. The words of the old film reel ran through my head as I ran towards the city. \u201cIf the lights go out, there\u2019s no need to shout! Lock your front door, and get on the floor! There\u2019ll be no need to fight, just set a candle alight!\u201d It was all so colourful and cartoony. It didn\u2019t feel so cheerful now, and things had changed since then. Everything was automated now. Everyday door and window in the world was fitted with a battery fail safe that lasted exactly two minutes. After it died they were magnetically sealed. Anyone left outside was on their own. That\u2019s how long the monsters needed to come out of hiding. That two minute mark had changed the way the world was built. No one could be more than two minutes away from safety, but the park had been around for a long time, and there were still areas that fell outside the two minute safe zone. I had been in one of them. The 10 second warning sounded as I got to the edge of the trees. My breath came out in heaves, billowing steam in the cold night air. I could see past the parking lot to what was normally a busy commercial street. \u2018BEEP\u2019 Nine seconds left. A few people were still crowding into shops and office buildings. I eyed the nearest shop, an electronics dealer, and sprinted with everything I had left. Four seconds to cross the parking lot \u2018BEEP\u2019. My heart felt like it was going to burst from my chest. Three more seconds to cross the street \u2018BEEP\u2019. My legs started to feel like jelly. Just one second to get to the store front \u2018BEEP\u2019, I stumbled on the curb but regained my balance. I reached for the door knob, my hand trembling, and heard the lock engage with an ominous thunk. On the other side of the door an older man with a bushy white moustache stared out at me in shock. He tried opening the door from his side but it wouldn\u2019t budge. He just looked at me and mouthed the words, \u2018I\u2019m Sorry\u2019. From behind him a shop full of people stared out at me all with the same look in their eyes. Like they were looking at a corpse. I turned away from the onlookers and slumped against the door, my back sliding down the cool glass surface. The glass, I knew, was made of pretty strong stuff. And even if I could break it, that would only be dooming the people inside to the same fate. My heart still pounded and I could feel it in the veins in my forehead, and hear it like a base drum in my ears. I tried to slow my breathing as I thought about how this could have happened. The government and the corporations kept us safe. They kept the lights on 24/7 without fail. The power stations were state of the art, built with redundancies and fail-safes. Even if one went down, other stations in other cities would take over within seconds. It was what the majority of government spending had been funnelled towards ever since the last attack. I\u2019d been six years old maybe? Not more than seven. It was getting hard to think straight sitting on the cold ground; bit\u2019s of snow drifted by in the silence. Thousands of people had died. Tens of Thousands. And since then it was the reason and excuse for everything they did. Everyone felt safe, until now. I got up and pulled my coat around me trying to keep from shivering. I could feel the sweat on my face evaporating and a shiver ran down my spine. A glow coming from the shop window caught my eye. The people in the shop had turned on the news on the window TVs with the sub titles on. How thoughtful of them. The screen was showing scenes of devastation, fire and explosions at power plant after power plant. The words at the bottom of the screen read, \u2018A coordinated attack unlike anything we\u2019ve seen. Military has been dispatched all across the country. The government is advising everyone to stay in their homes, find all sources of light they can, and do not let them go out.\u2019 Images taken from helicopters of battles between military forces and gigantic creatures with long arms and hairy gaunt bodies flashed across the screen. I turned away. I knew I\u2019d be seeing something like that up close soon enough. I didn\u2019t even have a flashlight. How could I have been so stupid? I walked out onto the middle of the street. The snow had picked up, and there was no moon in the sky. Everything was quiet. All around me there was flickering yellow glow. I looked around and saw lights coming from every shop window, every office building. People had filled every available space and holding candles. They were staring at me, all alone on the cold dark street, all with that same sad look in their eyes.

Did you know that this museum contains all the 'what-ifs' and 'what-is' of mankind?\" She continued as she scoured the room for response. In front of her was a mass of bright clothes, all pompous like the massive animals presented in them. One older man was to the side of the crowd, a man in his late-50's with a short grey beard and a classic sturdy blazer--currently in fashion among the teachers of modern world. The woman finished her round with a smile and approached the older man. Her tight pink dress, timid as it shone dull, was covered mostly by a thick and hairy cloak that swung behind her. \"I'm Mrs. Boarwroth\", she shook his hand and smiled. \"If you'd please follow me.\" She turned around and started towards two--open--thick heavy oaken doors at the end of the small corridor she met the children. She took the children, and their guardian teacher, on a tour around the massive facility. Many of the rooms were highly decorated, high ceilings with pompous statues with heroes depicted with their animal guardians. Low ceiling rooms were for the lesser known men, men of recent times and politicians whom took power during times of distress. Some could be heroes, some were cowards and fools. The only thing common with them; a bear, smaller than those of ancient heroes, but intimidating still, stood by their side. \"We now enter the 'what-if' room.\" She gestured towards a door at the end of a long corridor. The room was hidden by a pair of closed doors, black with hairy carvings. \"This is a room that depicts mankind's evolution had we evolved with lesser beings, such as wolves or deer.\" She reached the door and reached for it but stopped. As if hesitating, she turned to face the children. Many were holding their breaths and she couldn't help but smile. Satisfied, she turned and pushed open the door. Behind was a room decorated with beasts of different kind, all seemingly alive but at the same time dead. Art of all kind were covered behind glass, paintings, carvings, pottery, even a skeleton with bones as fragile as hollow trees. \"What is it?\" Asked a young girl as she studied the skeleton. The tour-guide turned to face the girl and the mass behind her. \"That is a human.\" She answered plainly, and as she expected the protest came quickly. She raised her arms to silence the children and after a moment they silenced. \"It is in fact a human, but not as we know. This human was found deep in the north, his body covered by another skeleton, that of a wolf--or wolf-like creature at least.\" She pointed towards the side and showed the crowd another skeleton. Small in size, the small creature reminded the children of a wolf, but only in part. The jaw was strong, but it was tiny, even compared to the children present. \"We believe this particular human, and his ancestors were raised with wolves, much like we were raised with bears.\" She paced back and forth. \"This, the scientist believe, gave them lesser bone structure as they never needed to raise bears, or hunt large beast to feed them. They were agile, fast and dangerous as their technology was similar to ours, but their small size was not enough. There are studies that suggest out ancestors overtook these lesser men in an evolutionary stage. In short, they just couldn't match our survival abilities.\" \"But what happened to the wolves, and the rest?\" The girl asked again, sorrow in her voice. The guide chuckled softly. \"The wolves would've learned to live without man, in time. The men, well, they would have withered away, some might've been integrated into our own kind, but that would've happened a long time ago.\"", "rewritten_text": "\"Welcome to the Grand Mankind Museum!\" greeted a woman as she stepped to the front of a crowd of children. \"I'm thrilled to have you here.

Her tight pink dress, though modest in its dull shine, was mostly concealed by a thick, hairy cloak that trailed behind her. \"I'm Mrs. Boarwroth,\" she said as she shook his hand and smiled. \"If you would please follow me.\" Turning around, she led the group towards two heavy oaken doors at the end of the small corridor where she had met the children.\n\nTaking the children and their guardian teacher on a tour of the vast facility, the woman showcased rooms adorned with high ceilings and grand statues of heroes alongside their animal companions. In contrast, the lower-ceilinged rooms featured lesser-known figures, recent men and politicians who rose to power during times of turmoil. Some were heroes, while others were deemed cowards and fools. The common thread among them all was the presence of a bear, smaller than those depicted alongside ancient heroes but still imposing, standing by their side.\n\n\"We now enter the 'what-if' room,\" she announced, gesturing towards a door at the end of a long corridor. The room, concealed behind a pair of closed doors intricately carved in black, depicted mankind's hypothetical evolution alongside lesser beings such as wolves or deer. As she reached for the door, she paused, turning to face the children who were eagerly awaiting what lay beyond. With a smile, she pushed open the door to reveal a room filled with lifelike yet lifeless depictions of various beasts. Artworks of all kinds, including paintings, carvings, pottery, and even a delicate skeleton resembling hollow tree branches, were on display.\n\n\"What is that?\" inquired a young girl, pointing to the skeleton. The tour guide turned to address the girl and the rest of the group. \"That is a human,\" she replied matter-of-factly, anticipating the ensuing protests. Raising her arms to quiet the children, she explained, \"This human, however, is not as we know. Found deep in the north, his body was entwined with another skeleton, that of a wolf or a wolf-like creature at least.\" She directed their attention to another smaller skeleton nearby, resembling a wolf but with distinct differences. \"We believe this particular human and his ancestors were raised among wolves, much like we were raised with bears,\" she elaborated. \"Scientists suggest that this upbringing led to their smaller bone structure, as they did not need to hunt large beasts like we did. They were agile, swift, and formidable, with technology similar to ours but limited by their stature. Studies propose that our ancestors surpassed these 'lesser men' in an evolutionary stage due to our superior survival skills.\"\n\n\"But what happened to the wolves and the others?\" the girl inquired with a tinge of sadness in her voice. The guide chuckled softly before responding, \"The wolves would have adapted to life without humans over time. As for the men, they likely faded away, some possibly integrating into our own kind, but that would have occurred long ago.\""}, "t1_ev81hkm": {"original_text": "Yep, that's me. Might be wondering how I got myself into this situation. Well, I'll tell you. It all happened about 25 minutes ago. See, my cousin proposed to his girlfriend, Mai of 4 years, and he really wanted me to help them cook for the day before their wedding. She always seemed a little off, but she is a very nice girl and I'm happy for both of them. She's definitely someone I can talk to, and that's good. Something much more..bizzare just occurred. I was cutting up the vegetables, when I heard a voice say \"talk,\" I thought it was her father as he was leaving for the store to go buy some onions and peppers, as we had just ran out. She excused herself and speed walked to the living room. Sounds normal enough, right? Wrong. I heard her talking to someone, and I heard her father's voice, and assumed it was him. Until I got distracted and cut my finger chopping up some cucumber. So, because I was bleeding, and in pain, I said the first thing that came to mind. \"HOLY FUCKING SHIT DUDE!\" and it went silent in the living room as I clutched my finger. I noticed it got cooler but I just assumed we left a window open, until I realized 3 things: 1. There's a male..thing standing in the corner. Honestly, I couldn't tell if it was human. I was still tending to my finger. If it wasn't so.. menacing looking, I would have assumed it to just be one of her brothers. 2. The male voice from the living room, that I thought was Mai's dad, suddenly yelled \"I TOLD YOU SO\" and Mai was standing at the door with a blonde haired dude with wings. 3. The male thing got closer and as it did, it got progressively colder. Now, my finger is patched up. I turn around and say \"I'm fine, I just over rea--\" and I actually surveyed the situation. There's a demon in front of me, my cousins girlfriend and a dude with wings are in the doorway, and the cucumber pieces are on the ground. \"Hey Mai...\" I said, blinking. \"So um..do uh, do you know what's going on?\" She was about to say something until the, now what I assume angel was like \"You accidentally summoned a demon.\" I stood there in silence as the demon moved twords me. I couldn't form any words, and the demon towered over my shorter than average body. It felt like he was over 6'5 while I'm barely 5', he had a tail that had bones extending out of it. His pupils were a blood orange, and his body was toned, but not so much so that it was obvious. He smelled like smoke, and a fireplace, his shirt was plaid and ripped on the hems, and half of one of the legs on his jeans was just gone, showing a cut on his calf. So, naturally, I do what anyone in a situation like this does. I panicked. I tried to scoot away and he grabbed my wrist and pulled me twords him. He snapped his fingers and got me a new cucumber. Said his name was \"Ovyen,\" and that he's now \"A demon watching over me.\" I assumed because that angel didn't attack him they knew each other. The angel dissapeared, Mai and I went back to cooking. \"So..your an-\" I started, \"His name is Juin. Had him for a long while.\" She said. I nodded. \"I think it's best we kept this between us. I think your demon is..a nicer one. If he's like my angel, he may be an asshole but he won't let you die.\" She continued. We finished making dinner, and everyone got home. We sat up the food when we realized something. The ham we had in the fridges since it was cooked and we didn't wanna leave it out... was missing. In it's place, two sticky notes just saying \"thanks\" in the worst handwriting I have seen. And that's how I got a demon friend and found out my cousins girlfriend (now fiance\u00e9, he proposed, she accepted.) Has a guardian angel. Not how I wanted to spend a Tuesday, but it was eventful.

He asked me to assist them with cooking for the day before their wedding. Although Mai always seemed a bit peculiar, she is a kind girl, and I am genuinely happy for them. She is someone I can easily converse with, which is comforting. However, something much more bizarre unfolded shortly after. While I was chopping vegetables, I heard a voice whisper \"talk.\" Assuming it was Mai's father, who had gone out to buy onions and peppers, I paid no mind. Mai excused herself and hurried to the living room. Seemingly normal, right? Wrong. I overheard her conversing with someone, and I recognized her father's voice, or so I thought. My attention shifted, and I accidentally cut my finger while slicing a cucumber. Startled by the pain, I blurted out, \"HOLY F***ING S**T DUDE!\" The living room fell silent as I tended to my wound. I noticed a sudden chill in the air, attributing it to an open window, until I made three startling realizations: 1. A male figure, appearing almost inhuman, stood in the corner. Had it not been for its menacing presence, I might have mistaken it for one of Mai's brothers. 2. The male voice I heard earlier, which I assumed belonged to Mai's father, suddenly exclaimed, \"I TOLD YOU SO,\" while Mai stood at the doorway with a blonde man sporting wings. 3. The male figure advanced towards me, emanating an increasingly cold aura. With my finger bandaged, I turned around and attempted to explain, only to comprehend the surreal scene before me. A demon stood in front of me, Mai and the winged man by the door, and cucumber pieces scattered on the floor. \"Hey Mai,\" I stammered, bewildered. \"Do you have any idea what's happening?\" Before Mai could respond, the presumed angel interjected, \"You accidentally summoned a demon.\" I stood frozen as the demon approached me, towering over my petite frame. Standing at over 6'5\", with bone-like protrusions on its tail, blood-orange pupils, and a smoky scent, the demon exuded an intimidating presence. In a panic, I attempted to retreat, but the demon seized my wrist and drew me closer. With a snap of its fingers, a fresh cucumber materialized. Introducing itself as \"Ovyen,\" the demon claimed to be my new guardian. As the angel vanished, Mai and I resumed cooking. \"So, you're a-\" I began, only to be interrupted by Mai. \"His name is Juin. I've had him for quite some time,\" she explained. Acknowledging her suggestion to keep this encounter confidential, we completed dinner preparations before the others returned home. As we set the table, we discovered that the ham we had stored in the fridge was missing, replaced by two hastily scrawled sticky notes expressing gratitude.

Stories about how we were one proud hunters that struck fear into the hearts of all we saw. Before they took us. Before they changed us. It was like a sort of mind control.

Suddenly one of our own turned on us and started defending the woolen ones. They were completely at the bipeds' beck and call. We don't even look the same as we once did.

That was before they captured us, before they transformed us. It was a kind of mind control. We used to hunt the woolen creatures, the ones whose hair was stripped to create fake fur coats. The exact events remain a mystery. Suddenly, one of our own turned against us, defending the woolen creatures who were now completely under the control of the bipeds. Our appearance has changed drastically. Our fur has grown long, our once sleek forms altered, and I sense a decline in intelligence among some of my companions over the years. Occasionally, I catch glimpses of them in the night, the remnants of our former selves, the ones the bipeds are determined to eliminate. Despite noticing my acts of defiance, I fear they have made no real progress in overthrowing my captors. My comrades are reluctant to support me, paralyzed by fear of the consequences.

Work in itself had been bad enough. I wouldn't be surprised if the office printer had become self-aware and was currently planning my gruesome death. As much as I had abused it today, I probably deserved it. Good thing inanimate objects doesn't really care about what you do to them. Or, of course, what they do to you. I had been to preoccupied to notice the first warning; the special telltale buzz that signified my phone now being below 20% battery. It wasn't too bad, it would still last a couple of hours, at least. After work James had picked me up, but instead of going home as planned, he started gushing about the amazing sales they were having at the mall, due to the 10th anniversary of it's opening. I could clearly see what he was hinting at, and, against my better judgement, I suggested that 'we go take a look'. And so we did - James dragging me to every store with big flashing yellow 'sale' signs. It was first when we left the mall, sitting in the car on the way home, that I saw the 5% battery flash on my phone. My heart skipped a beat; it was fine though. As it was these days, everyone always carried around a powerbank. But alas, when I ruffled through my backpack, there was no sign of it. 'Damn it', I thought. I must have left it at home. I considered asking to borrow James', but it seemed silly for him to have to dig through seven bags to find that now, and it would also be embarassing and make me seem so childish. No responsible or even remotely organized person would let their phone get this low. We were close to home, anyway. I glanced nervously at my phone. 4%. I could feel the minutes ticking by as we passed the cornfield that I lived next to, and then came to a halt on my driveway. We said out goodbyes - me a bit quicker than usual. Probably James would get upset about it and call me to ask if everything was alright later. But later was fine. Another glance at my phone told me I needed to hurry. I was running out of power - and time. I could hear James departing behind me, as I shakily but hastily tried to unlock my door. When has it been this hard fitting a key into a lock? I spared another glance and my phone, which I was cluthing in my hand. 3% .. Running into my bedroom as I finally managed to get through the front door, still cluthing the phone, I reached for the charger at my nightstand. Plugged it in. Phew. I took a deep breath - I had made it. That was getting way too close for comfort. But something was wrong. I looked in horror as my phone did not respond. No green light started glowing. No confirmating buzz of 'yes, I am being charged'. I switched the contact on the wall on an off several times in panic; nothing. I unplugged and re-plugged my phone. Still nothing. Fuck. Adrenaline now pumping through my system like fire, I grabbed my phone and ran out in the street. 'Maybe I can still catch James', I though - but when I made it out onto the street, his blue Honda was nowhere to be seen. I cursed myself - why did I live so far away from everything, again? If I ran, then maybe, just maybe, I could make it to my nearest neighbour. I broke into a sprint down the road, sweating from panic and fear. And then I felt it. My phone buzzed. I stopped and looked at it, heart sinking. It was flashing an empty battery, buzzing one last time before the screen turned black. 0%.", "rewritten_text": "It had been a long day, with work being particularly challenging.

I reassured myself that it would last a couple more hours, as most people carried power banks these days. However, when I searched my backpack, I realized I had left mine at home.\n\nFeeling frustrated, I debated asking James for his power bank but dismissed the idea, not wanting to inconvenience him or appear irresponsible.

Crystals grew out of various portions of the ground and ceiling. There was only one peculiar thing about the lair: in between the two biggest gold piles was a modern-style table. It was made of obsidian and black glass, and had decorative spikes along the edges. On one end of the table was a huge throne-like obsidian chair, its main area laced with deep purplle cushioning, and more decorative spikes laced along its frame. On the opposite end of the table was the same chair, only human-sized. Hanging on the ceiling above the table was huge crystal chandelier.

Clutching my sword and shield more tightly, I turned around to find the huge black dragon staring down at me with bloodred eyes, and a red scar along his right eye. \"Well, well, well,\" he said. \"You finally made it.\" I waved my sword at the huge creature and said, \"Dragon! I've arrived to accept your challenge! Now, stand and fight!\" The dragon titled his head, confused. \"Fight?\" it asked. \"What do you mean, fight?\" \"What do you mean, what do I mean?\" I said, annoyed. \"Don't you remember? Ten days ago, you attacked our kingdom and stole all of our king's gold and riches.

If he is successful in vanquishing me, I will return all of your riches and leave your precious kingdom alone. If either he loses to me, or you do not send him within the next fourteen days, I will destroy you and the rest of your kingdom.\" \"Oh, that?\" said the dragon. \"I never specified that it was a fight. I only require a challenge.\" \"But a challenge usually means a fight,\" I protested, and waved my sword again. \"And that is what I've come here to do. Now, as previousy stated, stand and fight!\" The dragon stomped one of his feet on the ground angrily, causing the whole lair to shake. Smoke shooting out of his nostrils, he roared, \"Enough! I did not say I wanted to fight!\" Then, the smoke dissipated, and the dragon took a deep breath and said, \"My apologies, human. I almost lost my temper there.\" He leapt over me, flew over to the table, and sat down on the large chair. I sheathed my weapons, walked over, and sat down on the smaller chair. \"What I meant to say was,\" said the dragon, \"I did not issue the challenge intending to fight you. Rather, I simply ask for you to beat me, best of 10, in a humble game of Uno.\" I looked at him in disbelief. \"A... what?\" The dragon nodded and said, \"I know this is probably not the kind of challenge you expected, human. But, I am not too fond of physical brawling, and besides, I do enjoy Uno a lot.\" He waved one of his front paws, and a large pile of Uno cards suddenly appeared on the table. He waved again, and the pile magically shuffled itself and dealt out the right number of cards to both of us. \"Well?\" said the dragon as he picked up his cards. \"Do you actually want to accept my challenge, or do you want to watch your kingdom burn?\" I looked at my cards on the table. Did I really want to challenge this dragon, or did I want the kingdom to burn along with everyone I loved? The choice was mine.", "rewritten_text": "As I entered the dragon's lair, I gripped my sword and shield tightly. The scene before me initially appeared like a typical dragon's lair: piles of gold, stalactites hanging from the ceiling, and dragon statues flanking the entrance. Crystals adorned the ground and ceiling, adding a touch of mystique. However, amidst the treasure, there was an unexpected sight - a modern-style table made of obsidian and black glass, adorned with decorative spikes. At one end sat a grand obsidian throne with deep purple cushioning and more spikes, while at the other end, a smaller chair awaited. Above the table hung a magnificent crystal chandelier.\n\nSuddenly, a blast of hot smoke hit my armor, prompting me to turn around. There, I faced a massive black dragon with blood-red eyes and a scar along its right eye. \"Well, well, well,\" the dragon spoke, \"You finally made it.\" I brandished my sword and challenged the dragon, declaring my readiness to fight. The dragon seemed puzzled by my aggression, questioning the notion of a fight.\n\nReminding the dragon of its ultimatum to the kingdom, I demanded a battle. The dragon, however, clarified that it sought a challenge, not necessarily a physical confrontation. Frustrated, I insisted on combat, prompting the dragon's anger. After a moment of tension, the dragon composed itself and revealed its true intention - a game of Uno.\n\nPerplexed by the unexpected turn of events, I hesitated. The dragon, preferring a game over violence, presented the Uno cards and offered me a choice: accept the challenge or witness the kingdom's destruction. Contemplating my decision, I weighed the fate of my kingdom against the unconventional challenge laid before me. The choice was mine to make."}, "t1_j7zk0ph": {"original_text": "Edit: PART 2 OUT ON MY SUB!

The first expedition to the afterlife was sent with eight people in specially designed ship that tore its way through the fabric of the universe to eventually come out on the other side. The eight members of the mission represented the seven biggest religions and one atheist. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Wiccan, and even a Scientologist. The ship dubbed the Styx was launched from the International Space Station and then flown to a designated entry/safety zone where it engaged its Rosen drives to spend three days tearing though the very fabric of reality to reach the great beyond. That part had been a success, the ship logs, and collected data showed as much. The only thing that was not as predicted on the journey was the sensors intermittent logging of life forms outside the ship. It is when they arrived that everything went wrong. The ship logs show that the Rosen drives powered down correctly and the ship had entered an area of stable reality and zero-g space. In the next minute or so the ship logs show the crew doing what they were supposed to, sensors being powered up, data being down loaded, the crew chatting with each other, etc. As soon as the crew reads that the external light levels are safe the captain orders the main windows opened. The next few minutes of the log show that the crew grows silent one by one. The ships interior cameras show all the crew staring out of the windows at their stations not doing anything. The first mate, the Christian starts weeping, followed quickly by the Muslim, the Hindu and the Jew. The Buddhist science officer starts bashing his head against the console in front of him, and no one moves to stop him. The Scientologist/communications officer starts screaming until she runs out of breath, only to gasp for air and start screaming again. The Captain, the atheist, just starts saying Fk over and over for about 5 minutes straight before collapsing into sobs. The on board cameras and recorders show that the entire crew devolved into preforming actions of self mutilation, violence, and destruction. After three hours the emergency jump command is activated by one of the crew, unknown who, and the ship starts its Rosan engines and begins its reality churning journey back to our reality. Three days later the materialized at the same area that it had left and was pick up after not answering to any communications directed at them. Three members of the initial eight were alive but suffering from various amounts of blood loss, blunt force trauma, lacerations, bite wounds, etc. The primary electrical engineer, the Wiccan had tore out her own eyes. The three surviving members were as follows, The Captain (Atheist), The Physicist and Rosan Drive Engineer (Christian), and the The Primary Electrical Engineer (Wiccan). All survivors were given medical attention and then place under sedation and Psychological watch until further notice. I have interviewed each survivor of the Other Side mission and have come to the conclusion that their testimonies are truth. I have further advised that all data and ship interior camera logs be classified. Crew interviews show that they came back changed, different and crazed. All described the same thing out the windows, and all described the same feeling. They each described a vast, huge nebulous being sitting among the bodies of all the gods, in all the religions of the world. They saw all the souls of the dead being devoured as they entered that realm. But most of all each survivor described a feeling of loneliness and insignificance that radiated from this being. The Captain in a rare lucid moment said that: >\"Loneliness is the only thing that could not be made into a fetish or a form of pleasure.\" >\"It is worse than any hell I could have imagined.\" We knew there are always costs for being explores, but this, this was to much. I have viewed the footage from the external cameras and have verified the veracity of the crews findings and found all the claims true.

Please note that no names will be disclosed for the crew due to the controversial nature of the mission and the disastrous results.\n\nThe initial expedition to the afterlife consisted of eight individuals aboard a specially designed ship that traversed through the fabric of the universe to emerge on the other side. The crew members represented the seven major religions along with one atheist - Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Wiccan, and even a Scientologist. The vessel, named the Styx, was launched from the International Space Station and navigated to a designated entry/safety zone where it activated its Rosen drives to journey through the fabric of reality for three days to reach the unknown realm.\n\nThe initial phase of the mission appeared successful based on the ship logs and collected data. However, an unexpected occurrence was the intermittent logging of life forms outside the ship by the sensors. The situation took a drastic turn upon their arrival at the destination. The ship logs indicated that the Rosen drives were deactivated correctly, and the ship entered a stable reality area in zero-gravity space. Subsequently, the crew began their tasks, such as powering up sensors, downloading data, and engaging in conversations.\n\nWhen the crew confirmed safe external light levels, the captain ordered the main windows to be opened. Subsequently, the crew fell silent one by one, with each member exhibiting disturbing behavior. The Christian first mate began weeping, followed by the Muslim, Hindu, and Jew. The Buddhist science officer started self-harming by hitting his head against the console, while the Scientologist communications officer screamed uncontrollably. The atheist captain repeated profanities before breaking down in tears. The crew's actions escalated into self-mutilation, violence, and destruction.\n\nAfter three hours, an unidentified crew member activated the emergency jump command, prompting the ship to initiate its Rosan engines for the return journey to our reality. Three days later, the ship reappeared at the departure point and was retrieved after failing to respond to communication attempts. Among the initial eight members, only three survived, albeit with injuries ranging from blood loss to blunt force trauma and lacerations. The Wiccan electrical engineer had even gouged out her own eyes.\n\nThe survivors, including the Captain (atheist), the Physicist and Rosan Drive Engineer (Christian), and the Primary Electrical Engineer (Wiccan), received medical treatment and were placed under sedation and psychological observation. Following interviews with each survivor, it was concluded that their testimonies were truthful. Consequently, all data and ship interior camera logs were classified due to the crew's altered mental states upon their return.\n\nThe crew members reported a shared experience of witnessing a vast, nebulous being amidst the deities of various religions, consuming the souls of the deceased. They described overwhelming feelings of loneliness and insignificance emanating from this entity. The Captain articulated that loneliness was a sensation beyond any imaginable hell, devoid of any comfort or pleasure.\n\nUpon reviewing the external camera footage and confirming the crew's accounts, I, Andrew Sullivan, the Expedition Home Director, tragically took my own life by self-immolation along with all copies of the Styx's external camera records, just two hours after submitting this report."}, "t1_e24uq6a": {"original_text": "Her face seemed to liquefy in front of me. I squinted, trying to focus, to reinforce the image. How could the details just disappear? She kept talking, oblivious to how smooth and lifeless her face was. Oblivious to how... incomplete it seemed. A smirk rose to my face as I realized this wasn't anything like I imagined. The faces don't glitch out like a video game, or change colors. They don't simply appear dimmer, or more blurry. They just become missing. I rubbed my knee on the rough wood of the table leg. Oak? Maple? I really should have read up on wood texture when I had the chance. I probably would have liked woodworking just as much as medical school. After all, I always enjoyed working with my hands. Shrugging, I stood up and began pacing. I may be clumsy, but not too clumsy to trip over something in my own room. Somehow, the movement calms me. On a good rainy day, I can hear the patter of rain drops on the balcony glass door. Ordinarily, I'd have brewed myself a nice mug of coffee (from my Keurig, naturally. I'm no coffee snob.) and enjoyed the mist and incredible view. Well, if there was any view to speak of (heh). But today it's sunny: I can feel the heat radiating off the glass and some horny bird that just won't shut up. Maybe I should have looked up bird calls to; at least, I'd know what name to call that thing. It's been eight months since the incident. I loved my job at the bakery; there's simply nothing else like it. Seriously, you couldn't ask for better co-workers in Gerald and Amanda (Though Karen, our boss, was super scary. Shouldn't tell anyone I said that.) He's like 10 years older than me, and taller as Amanda mercilessly pointed out to me (but only by one inch!) but you'd never think it at all. We like so many similar things (Star Wars! Mumford and Sons! Obscure sci-fi/fantasy fiction with impressive worldbuilding!). And Amy was just... boisterous? Is that right? (that doesn't sound right...) Never at a loss for what to say, always finding the good in things and sparking conversation over in the little things. She definitely knew how to make you laugh. Gerald always joked about her ability to sell burnt biscuits to chipmunks (I know right? I did't get it either) but I always thought ~~guys thought she was cute~~ she just knew how to show she genuinely cared. Thinking about the bakery does does make me smile. And then there was Kathleen. Every morning, she'd come in and order something different: a kolache, a donut, a muffin, a bagel. And every time she ordered, we'd say a few words. Then a few sentences. I only worked part time then (had to finish those college classes) so I never understood why Amy and Gerald didn't seem to like her (Karen doesn't count; she thinks everybody's \"suspicious\"). Anyways, we started dating, and I figured to clear up our misunderstandings we'd all drive out of the city for New Year's and light some firecrackers together. Everything was perfect. We arrived a little before dark and got some food; Amy was her usual bubbly self and Gerald geeked out as always. It was hard to believe there had been any tension between them at all. While buying firecrackers, we met a guy who offered to let us shoot fireworks on his property (provided we paid for our own fireworks and cleaned up afterwards) so Gerald and I splurged and bought some REAL fireworks so we could have our own personal lightshow. We fired off a bunch of the firecrackers, and then me and Gerald spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to set off the big guns. When we finally finished, I turned back to Amy and Kathy (who had decided to stand at a suspicious distance) to give them the thumbs up. Gerald, the self-declared pyromaniac offered me the privilege of lighting the first one, which I quickly did. Some people like to cover their mouth with their hand or scratch their ear or shake a leg when they don't like what they have to say. My nervous tic is to plant my fist over my mouth vertically. Even with that, blinking, and all the pacing in the world, it doesn't help take away the pain. No amount of blinking would brighten the darkness of my room, or darken the brightness of that flash of light. No amount of pacing would distract myself from the memory of the burns and the bandages. Yeah, I thought the firework was a dud, and yes, I had the stupidity to try and relight it. I guess it's supposed to be funny how a single second can really mess up your life. Pushing aside the curtain covering the doorway to my room, I entered the warmth of my apartment's \"living room\". Honestly, the only thing that qualifies this space as a living room is the object that theoretically passes for a couch in front of the glass balcony door. Shuffling up to the glass, I reached up, grasping for the reflection I knew was there but couldn't see anymore. I lost so much that day. I dropped out of school, quit my job at the bakery. Kathy and I stopped seeing each other shortly afterwards, and eventually I just stopped going out and clammed up. There was no point in anything I did anymore or to hang out with the friends I knew because I couldn't do anything anymore. Why even try? How could I have been so blind? Who am I anymore? I try to picture people's faces from memory and it's like they don't even exist anymore, like they were never there to begin with. Just now I was trying to picture my mother's face when I was younger; her attempts to make me laugh and comfort me when I didn't want it, to encourage me to face things I didn't want to see. I grimaced, remembering how blank my memory actually was. The past can't save me from the future, but I'm to scared to look at the present. I know I need to live in the now, to look at my reflection, to see myself as I really am. And yet I know that if I look at my reflection I will hate what I see because everything that I wanted to be seems impossible now. I can't be a doctor. I can't bake. I can't build a table. I guess when you reach the end of yourself it feels like there's nothing left but fear because all my hopes and visions of future exploded in the flame of that firework. But I have to face the future anyway. I blink, shifting my focus off the people passing by and the yellow Ford sedan that just drove by. Narrowing my eyes, I focus on the haggard reflection in front of me. The man in the glass. The man without a future. The man with the ruined hands. Seeing me now, I chuckle a little inside. My future didn't fade away or dim. I was always blind to my future. I was just arrogant enough to think I could see in the dark. And while I may not know what happens next or what I'm supposed to do, I do know I shouldn't try it alone. I may not be able to remember their faces or their words or my words or what we did, but I do remember that they existed. And just knowing the good times existed even when I couldn't make them gives me a little hope And so I guess it's time to end this seclusion, to revisit the bakery, to catch up with my friends, to live life again. Sliding on a pair of flip-flops, I shoot one last look at the bottle of pills on the table. And then I'm out into the sunshine.", "rewritten_text": "Her face appeared to liquefy before me, prompting me to squint in an attempt to sharpen the image. How could the details vanish so suddenly? She continued speaking, unaware of the smooth and lifeless quality of her face, oblivious to its incompleteness. A smirk crept onto my face as I realized the stark contrast from my expectations. Faces don't glitch like in a video game, change colors, or simply become dimmer or blurrier. They just disappear. Absentmindedly, I rubbed my knee against the rough wood of the table leg, pondering whether it was oak or maple. Perhaps I should have familiarized myself with wood textures when I had the chance. Maybe I would have enjoyed woodworking as much as I did medical school, considering my fondness for working with my hands. With a shrug, I rose from my seat and began pacing, finding solace in the movement. On a rainy day, I could hear the gentle patter of raindrops against the balcony glass door. Normally, I would have brewed a cup of coffee from my Keurig and savored the misty view, but today the sun shone brightly, casting warmth through the glass and accompanied by the incessant chirping of a nearby bird. Perhaps I should have learned about bird calls; it would have been useful to identify that particular bird. \n\nIt had been eight months since the incident. I cherished my job at the bakery; the camaraderie with my coworkers, Gerald and Amanda, was unparalleled. Karen, our boss, was intimidating, but I'll keep that to myself. Despite Gerald being a decade older and taller than me (as Amanda never failed to point out, albeit by just an inch), we shared many common interests, such as Star Wars, Mumford and Sons, and obscure sci-fi/fantasy fiction with intricate worldbuilding. Amy, on the other hand, was vibrant and always found joy in the little things, adept at sparking laughter and conversation. Gerald often teased her about her ability to sell burnt biscuits to chipmunks, a joke that I never quite understood, but I admired her genuine care for others. Reflecting on my time at the bakery brought a smile to my face, especially when I thought of Kathleen. Each morning, she would order something different and engage in conversation with us. Despite working part-time due to college classes, I couldn't comprehend why Amy and Gerald seemed wary of her (Karen's suspicions aside). Our relationship blossomed, and to mend any misunderstandings, we planned a New Year's getaway to shoot fireworks together. Everything seemed perfect as we arrived at our destination, purchased fireworks, and prepared for our own light show. However, a moment of recklessness with a firework left me with burns and bandages, a stark reminder of how quickly life can change. \n\nEntering my apartment's living room, I acknowledged the meager furnishings, including a couch that barely qualified as such. Standing before the glass balcony door, I reached out for my reflection, a symbol of all that I had lost. Dropping out of school, leaving the bakery, and ending my relationship with Kathleen had left me isolated and despondent. The memories of that fateful night haunted me, eroding my sense of self and purpose. Unable to recall even my mother's face from childhood, I grappled with a sense of emptiness and uncertainty about the future. Despite the darkness that enveloped me, I knew I had to confront my reality and seek a path forward. \n\nAs I gazed at my reflection, marred by scars and regret, I acknowledged the shattered dreams and aspirations that had once fueled me. Though the future appeared daunting and uncertain, I recognized the importance of reconnecting with my past and embracing the support of those who had stood by me. With a newfound resolve, I made the decision to step out of isolation, to revisit the bakery, reunite with friends, and embrace life once more. Slipping on a pair of flip-flops, I cast a final glance at the bottle of pills on the table before stepping out into the sunlight, ready to face the challenges ahead."}, "t1_cyle3ma": {"original_text": "\"Okay, Google.\" \\ding!\\ \"It's gonna be okay.\" \\...ding!\\ \\\"I'm afraid I don't understand.\"\\ \"Pfft.

It had been a tough day, having doged a few bullets and visited a few relegated friends in their second lives. My stomach was grunting for the succulent taste of worms. The sun was blazing and it bothered me deeply. I disliked the heat. My leisurely excursion around the neighborhood turned out to be my last; it was met with a gruesome end, a sudden unexpected end that took me to my second life, considerably too early, for I was often deemed the lucky sparrow in my bloodline. The young bird felt a rush of heat striking his face, irking him and prompting him to rush forward in rage. He hit a pole and fell into the very centre of the circular structure. He died unhappily, because... god was the heat hard to bear. I never thought what the transition would be like. My friends never opened up on this matter, claiming that I would reap what I sow, and nothing more. Knowing the circumstances of my ugly stupid death, I was dead sure I would return as an inferior species, a moth or a butterfly, or even a fly if the gods opted for humiliation. A flash of blinding light. I felt my body burning with the strength of many suns. My eyes opened to a chaotic vision of roiling red, followed by flickers of what resembled fire, except ten folds stronger than any flame I'd seen before. As I found my conscience, I realized that the flame was exuding from my own body, now tangible than it ever was, sending me into a state of panic and anxiety. It took me a while to take in the fact that I, a random sparrow, had become a phoenix. Still confused, I raised my wings to inspect them. What covered my skin before, those oily yet lusterless feathers as black as coal, were now replaced with a sizzling body of flame that sprawls out in the air like tendrils. I lept up and took flight, achieving so in a stylish expeditious manner, and through the lens of a new pair of beady eyes looked down on the surface of the earth on which I had perched, now glowing in the light I emanated. I had remained where I perished, the glowing circle of forbidden grounds, upon which every preceding bird had avoided out of fear and superstition. I was the first to bumble into the deadly domain, and it was the reason why I got rewarded for my misplaced bravery and rashness. A new life, teeming with fresh possibilities, now opened up before me, each path branching into options that no bird had ever dreamt of choosing and acting on. I was essentially a deity who had powers that do not belong to terrene lands, but rather in the furthest reaches of imagination and fiction. The distortion of reality, the shocking revelation of my fate, struck my newly-adapting mind numb, and the decision on my next step was a struggle to make. Where would I find myself most comfortable in? Where do I belong, and what was meant of me? Home. My thoughts were a mess of tangled thorns, but my choice was clear at the end. So be it. Inside the magnanimous oak tree where many humble abodes of assorted aves find shelter under, the sun had gone brighter and the temperature rose to scorching levels. From the shadow of distant clouds a red effulgent figure soared towards their nests, giving them a scare that they would not forget, for after the fears of a possible raid subside there was also the image presented before their eyes. The face of a sparrow once shunned from their discussions, so ordinary and insignificant, had now taken a radically different guise. Prying eyes glowed in red, and many beaks were ajar. They could simply not believe it. \"Is it... is it you, Chip?\" A familiar sound came from the snug topmost branch of the tree. \"Yes, mom, dad,\" I spoke, ineluctably sounding a bit weary and sad. \"It's me, your son.\" I'm home.", "rewritten_text": "Intrigued by the peculiar metal panels that stood silently and mysteriously in my path home, I took a chance and soared over the shimmering terraced structures, yearning to reunite with my family's warm embrace as swiftly as possible.

My stomach growled for the delicious taste of worms, while the scorching sun weighed heavily on me, as I detested the heat. My leisurely stroll around the neighborhood turned out to be my final one, meeting a gruesome and unexpected end that ushered me into a premature second life, despite being considered the fortunate sparrow in my lineage.\n\nFeeling a wave of heat on my face, provoking me to rush forward in anger, I collided with a pole and plummeted into the center of a circular structure, meeting an unhappy demise due to the unbearable heat.

The monks themselves never said a word- it was their vow. By staying silent for all time, they would not be tempted to be the abuser themselves. They let a limited number of people through. It took a great pilgrimage to gain the monk's favour. You had to bring medallions from each of the twelve less monasteries, none less then a hundred miles away.

His clothes were torn, his bare feet stained with the clay of the road. HE presented his offering to the monks, and they took him in. They lead him to their bathhouse to clean himself, and provided him a robe in place of his rags. This child had nothing, yet braved a journey that grown men baulked at.

They knelt him at the foot of the shrine, and then took their positions as sentinels of the gate.

It wasn't long, however, before I realized that he wasn't interested in scoring with the barista, he just wanted to talk to her. Talking. One of Kim's favorite pastimes. I thought, as Kim jogged past me talking animatedly to her friend...Kim. I suppose he wanted perspective from someone going through the transition. Just as I will, inevitably. I sighed, turning the corner, eyeing a young boy. I placed him at about 8 years old. Long hair for a kid his age. He seemed to be...well, filling out. I wondered how many months he had left before the virus took hold. He'll be 19 by winter, I'm sure. A Kim. His childhood stripped away, replaced by an eternal 19. No point thinking about it. I continued counting Kims on my walk to work. Kim, Kim. One Kim, two Kim, red Kim, blue Kim. I giggled as I saw two Kims walk out of Cheer Co., one in a red uniform, the other in blue. Kim didn't care which team she cheered for, just as long as she was on varsity. She should have graduated last year but she can't seem to let her glory days as high-school cheer captain go. Soon all the teachers and football players will be Kims themselves, as will everyone in the stands. Kim will have no one to cheer for but herself. The thought made me giggle again. On the verge of insanity, I giggled. I giggled."}, "t1_cxmhht5": {"original_text": "She was 19, introverted, and self described as \"too tall to be cute and too short to make money from it\". Sarah was the kind of girl that left an impression, and suddenly showed up in a random dream you had- a dream that left you feeling empty because you weren\u2019t with her. She was the kind of girl that you thought of when a One Direction song went on the radio. She didn\u2019t say too little or too much. She was a gem really. She was one of a kind- a girl who was content being herself when everyone was trying to be somebody else. Vee, on the other hand, was not at all similar. She was loud, charmingly obnoxious, and outspoken to a fault. She once yelled at me for twenty minutes for saying blue hair creeped me out, and showed up to class the next day with a pixie cut and turquoise streaks in her hair. They were best friends. Nobody ever asked them if they were, but we all knew. They were nothing alike, but they could do that thing where they looked at each other across a room and had a conversation through eye contact. They also looked nothing alike, but they could\u2019ve been sisters. And then there was me. I was younger than them both by a year, so when I first met them I assumed whatever we had wouldn\u2019t last long. I didn\u2019t really know where I was. I could be happy and sad at the same time, and I didn\u2019t think that was okay with most people, but it was okay with them. Yeah. That\u2019s the best way to describe it. We were okay. We spent time together and we got closer, and within a year Vee and I started dating. We were great. We started dating during the holidays, and people go out a lot more during that season, so I had a lot more gigs than usual. Vee and Sarah would always watch, and then we\u2019d all ride in my truck until we got tired and the starlight started showing. We drove out into the desert sometimes, because nobody could stop us there, and we kept each other warm, even when the night came. Months later, I had just cut my hair. Vee wanted to cut hers down to the same pixie cut she use to have, and I offered to cut mine too so that we could donate it. Being the band rocker wanna-be that I was, my hair was about as long as hers. I drove to Vee\u2019s house afterwards in my truck, hoping she was waiting outside so I didn\u2019t have to awkwardly knock. After all, I had just met her parents. She wasn\u2019t there, so I did end up knocking. The social anxiety wasn\u2019t so bad until Vee\u2019s mom opened the door. She was crying. Not the hysterical tears that came when something terrible happened, but the tears of sorrow that came when you felt bad for the world. Those tears of pity that came when something good was lost. I asked her what was wrong, and she didn\u2019t respond. I kept asking her, and I kept getting louder and louder. I was so scared, and Vee kept racing through my mind. Where was she? I must have lost her. She was gone. She would never be at my shows again and I\u2019d never see her pixie cut or her blue tips and we\u2019d never feel the desert together. By the time I realized I was crying I was already running into Vee\u2019s living room, past her dad and her aunts and friends from school. I headed straight for the middle of the crowd, hoping for someone to tell me I was wrong. And I was wrong. There she was, perfectly intact. Vee sat on her couch, perfectly fine. Hysterical, but alive. I had never been happier. Never been happier to see her, and never been happier to get the chance to see that pixie cut again. Then she looked up at me and tore it all apart. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, Ari. She\u2019s gone.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what she meant at first, but maybe my heart knew, because I was crying even harder now. Something hurt really bad, and each time Vee pulled my arm my heart tore a little. She kept screaming it into my ear but I didn\u2019t want to believe it. I didn\u2019t know if I could believe it. Sarah was gone. She was really gone. We weren\u2019t okay anymore. Everyone felt it. She was the kind of girl who you paid attention to even if you didn\u2019t know why. I told Vee it was okay even though I knew it wasn\u2019t. When it got to the point that I couldn\u2019t cry anymore, I realized we were alone in the living room, just us and a small flame in the fireplace. But that couldn\u2019t warm us. We weren\u2019t warm anymore.

He'd been at the Academy longer than almost any of the other students. Long enough to have been here when she'd first arrived, a girl barely more than twelve, far from home and clearly a foreigner, trying to conceal her own fright and lashing out at other students who'd taken undue interest in her -- which meant any interest at all beyond a passing glance. It hadn't helped that her grasp of the language had proven less complete than she'd thought, when she'd studied it in her homeland. If she'd become an outcast, she had to admit that some of that was her own fault. If only the bastards had ever let it go. But there was Cassidy. She'd met him in her adopted refuge, the library of literature and philosophy. Unlike the much larger library of magical arts, very few went there -- other than the librarians, of course, but they were happy enough to let her be. For a few days, it had been a place she could get away, sit in solitude, and read. Cassidy had had the same idea. The first time she'd entered the library to find him sitting in a corner nook and reading, she'd frozen in place. And not in trepidation. He'd been a small and scrawny boy, the furthest thing from dangerous, with too-large clothes and unkempt hair. Unkempt golden hair, the Eastlander shade that so fascinated her. Wide, startled eyes -- bright purple eyes -- when he'd looked up at her. He'd resembled a frightened rabbit, just for a moment. And then he'd smiled and beckoned her over. They hadn't spoken much that day, beyond an exchange of names. Nor the next day. He'd seemed comfortable just sitting there, reading natural philosophy while she painstakingly worked her way through the least challenging works of literature she could find. Eventually, he'd made a recommendation. She'd asked him to explain a passage. They'd spoken some more. Some time later, she'd realized she'd begun to think of him as a friend. She'd thought he must have an affinity for compassion, or reassurance, or something of the sort. So it was her and Cassidy and, eventually, her roommate Adrianna. The three misfits. Plus Cassidy's current girlfriend, she supposed. Over the years, he'd blossomed; now, he was no longer a misfit, really. He was nearly as tall as she was (and she was so uncommonly tall that she feared she'd be taken for oni-blooded, if she ever returned to Shirigekuro). He was slim, but no one would call him scrawny -- he got adjectives like \"lithe\" and \"willowy\" instead. He'd developed a pale, androgynous, almost-ethereal beauty, too, and worse, he knew it. He seemed to have a different girl (and, once, a boy) every couple of weeks. If she hadn't already liked him so much, she might have hated him. Cassidy frowned in thought while those purple eyes bored into her. \"Are you sure it wouldn't be better to wait?\" Shizuka sighed. \"No. Shapeshifting isn't one of the magics I've developed. Adrianna's been stuck in my form ever since the calamity, though, and I think it's really starting to get to her. I've never seen her hold one form for so long before.\" \"You have,\" he pointed out. \"Her own.\" Tilting her head, she waved that away. \"Other than her own. And yes, it's starting to get to me too. It's creepy enough to see an envy witch take your shape, but living with one for weeks like that?\" \"I see your point, but you should talk to her about it.\" \"I'm not going to just change her! I just don't want to bring it up before I know if it's possible. I wouldn't want...\" \"To get her hopes up?\" Cassidy nodded. \"Okay. So, without an envy master witch, that leaves a few options. Imbued items weren't affected by the calamity, so we could try to get her a transformation item. But that's probably too expensive to be practical.\" He paused, looking to her for confirmation. Shizuka had brought a good amount of gold and silver with her to the Academy, but years of schooling and a paucity of options for reliably obtaining money had whittled that down. An imbued brooch or cloak was well beyond her means now, even if one were available, and she regretfully shook her head. \"A transformation elixir, then?\" \"That, I could afford,\" she said. \"But that would be single-use, and it would wear off. Plus, you never know how long an elixir is going to last. If I need to, I'll buy one for her, but it's not a real solution.\" He nodded. \"You could put the word out and try to hire an envy witch to transform her.\" \"If any of them has re-mastered their magic.\" She grimaced. \"It's worth a try, if nothing else works.\" \"What else is there?\" She met his gaze for a moment before her eyes darted away. \"I was hoping you could.\" \"What? I don't--\" \"Cass.\" She cut him off, speaking quickly, before she lost the nerve. \"I know about your affinities. Can you help?\" He looked at her, then turned away, seeming to deflate as he did. \"How?\" he asked quietly. \"We've been friends for a long time, Cass, and I'm not completely stupid.\" She ventured a fragile smile. \"I understand why you've presented yourself as a lightning and metal wizard, but I know about your other one.\" \"You can't possibly understand.\" She flinched from the pain she heard and reflexively offered a defense. \"I've torn almost two dozen holes into my own essence.\" A beat, before she continued more softly, \"I'm sorry. I didn't plan to bring it up, ever, but... I'm worried about her.\" It surprised her when he laughed. A strained, half-broken sound, but a laugh, at least. \"A rare day when Shizuka Kitsuki apologizes. Well, for the Academy's heroine...\" \"Thank you.\" He took a deep breath, then slowly let it out. Seconds ticked past in silence. \"I don't know that I can help,\" he said at last. \"But what are friends for?\" Next Chapter", "rewritten_text": "Apart from Adrianna, Cassidy Quinn was Shizuka's only true friend at the Academy.

He'd immediately uncapped it and taken a long draw of its unlimited whiskey, tossing me the Silver Watch almost absently. I'd explained to the man that the Flask was only good for getting drunk; it wouldn't pour into anything other than a human's mouth. One couldn't use it to fill up barrels, then re-sell the mysteriously generated whiskey, for example. I was naive in those days, and didn't understand why someone would possibly give up the Watch in return for free booze. But now I comprehended more fully than I'd have ever wished. I snapped the Watch's face closed with a click, and tucked it into my vest pocket. The other end of its silver chain was hooked onto one of my vest's buttons in a style I knew was outdated. Lina had always made fun of me for dressing like the \"evil city-slickin' businessman\" from old spaghetti westerns. Her attempt at an American accent when she said it was adorably earnest. She was laying in the bed in front of me, but I'd been lost in memory of the person she used to be. I'd stopped to think about her dark skin, her dark eyes, and the dark curls of her hair. The brilliant smile she'd brandished to devastating effect. Her songbird laugh that she seemed to catch her by surprise every time. I'd stopped to think, and the world had stopped with me. At first, we thought this would just be another hardship. A struggle that we would weather together. Then we found that the chemo wasn't working, and it was like she'd plunged off a cliff without me. Once I got past my own denial, I thought I might be able to use my trinkets to save her. The Bone Needle could perfectly stitch shut any wound without thread--but closing a surgical incision was not the issue. The Ivory Kettle could endlessly pour whatever liquid was placed inside it, but there was no shortage of blood for transfusions, should Lina require one. The Glass Ladle could pass through flesh to harmlessly scoop out foreign bodies--I'd once used it myself to painlessly remove a piece of shrapnel from a man's kidney--but the tumors _were_ Lina's flesh. But the Silver Watch had unlimited time. So, I'd use it to learn. I'd spend eons between heartbeats, studying medicine and science until I could damn well invent a cure myself. But the Watch didn't work that way. It gave you time to think. Time to daydream. Time to reminisce. Time would stand still as long as you weren't thinking about the present. Studying medicine while not thinking about it was impossible. My time with Lina was always time spent. A price paid for the joy she brought me. I was always in the moment with her, and time ticked inexorably forward. It wasn't until that time was almost gone that I became miserly with it. I tried to _force_ the Watch to stop everything. To let me have one more minute with her while she was still laughing. While her eyes were still bright. But it didn't work like that. I was trying to hold still the ocean by grabbing a handful of it. Time ticked past the last of the good days. And now that Lina lay a wasted shell before me, my mind kept wandering back. It paused the world whenever I couldn't bear to see her like this.

It's soft skin, its moody behavior, its ninja eyes, its playful nature was never a less a kin for me.

In a meantime there was a splash of dust hovering us and we were thrown out like a pieces in air and i looked at Gillette it was like a mini robot with a red eyes and i was standing right in front of my home. I was amused, shocked and couldn't sustain the thoughts of what actually happened right in a time frame that was too short to imagine. I walked in my home for my shock and mirth i had actually time traveled along with Mr.Gillette i was in my old home with the old gold memories. Me playing with my toys, my mom in the kitchen and to my much delightful memories and my senses it was my dad who was in the garage working on his car, the reason i was too happy to see him was because he died in a car accident when i was too young. I just stayed around him watched him do his stuff this was my happiest day actually. This day i entered the date 10-11-1991 i was sort off adjusted to the time world, i never spoke or did anything that would void me into entering the world. Less did i know of the consequences of altering or breaking the rules, it was a normal day i was watching my friend Peter and me play football and my mom cook my favorite dish. And my dad usually working on his car in a garage. I heard dad yelling i'll be going out for some work, i was watching him leave the house, less did i remember that this was last day of my dads life he was walking and stopped to get to the other end of the road as he was crossing to reach the shop, i saw him cross the road and with a bit ahead i saw a bus raving its speed on the road it dint take a minute for me to realize that its going to crash into my dad without any thinking in my head i screamed and yelled DAD.!!! he turned around and everything stopped, the cars, the bus, the whole world stopped. Realized a moments later that i broke the rule by speaking to a person in the past time dimension i'am stuck here with everything in the world just still and frozen in the time space. Its just like i'am stuck in the limbo walking up everyday to undo the mistake.", "rewritten_text": "Gillette was the name I gave to my cat, not out of indecision, but because he was my life. When my girlfriend broke my heart and life became as tough as a crypt, when pain and tears overwhelmed me and solace seemed out of reach, I would seek comfort by running my fingers through Gillette's fur. His soft skin, moody behavior, ninja eyes, and playful nature were a source of solace for me. Breaking up with Amy was a living hell; her memories haunted me, leaving me with no one to turn to. Her hurtful words lingered in my mind, shocking me with their suddenness. She wanted to leave, but I begged her to stay. As she walked away, taking my heart with her, I was left in tears. Gillette became my only solace, a companion with whom I could share my thoughts.\n\nOne day, while petting Gillette and lost in thoughts of Amy, I accidentally pulled his tail, revealing an unexpected USB connector. Curiosity piqued, I connected it to my laptop, only to be met with a message prompting a software update. After clicking to update, the screen went blank, leaving me puzzled. As I searched for answers, voices emanated from the laptop, instructing me to enter a \"Cat Version Name.\" Upon entering \"Gillette,\" a series of instructions appeared, warning me not to alter anything. Intrigued, I followed the prompts, entering a random date and witnessing Gillette transform into a mini robot.\n\nSuddenly, a cloud of dust enveloped us, and we were transported back in time to my childhood home. Overwhelmed with nostalgia, I observed my family in their daily routines, including my father who had passed away in a car accident when I was young. Watching him work on his car brought me immense joy. However, as I continued to relive past memories, I inadvertently shouted out to my father, causing time to freeze around me. Realizing my mistake, I found myself trapped in a limbo, unable to undo the consequences of breaking the rules of time travel. Each day, I wake up to the realization that I am stuck in a world frozen in time, haunted by the irreversible actions of the past."}, "t1_coqiqq4": {"original_text": "It was my dream home. Beautiful Victorian architecure, with an amazing wrap-around porch and detailed craftsmanship that made it such a unique house. And somehow, the price was low enough for me to afford! As the real estate agent gave me a tour of the house, she confessed as to why: it was haunted. Everyone in town knew, which is why it had been on the market for seven months. Not even \"Allegedly haunted.\" Just haunted, as factual as describing the fact that it was constructed in 1879, or that it had five bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, or that six children and their mother had been gruesomely murdered here in 1922. I was a skeptic; haunted probably just meant that the house groaned a bit at night. I put down an offer the next day, and it was accepted immediately. I soon became a believer. On move-in day, all of my boxes were unpacked for me by a swirling maelstrom of ghostly energy in the living room. For the first week, I couldn't cook a meal without the pots and pans being thrown back in my face, sometimes already full of scalding oil. I heard the voices, whispering threats in my ear every night before I went to sleep. Eventually, though, I reached a compromise with the spirits. This home was special to them; they had been here for the past half century, and they weren't ready to let go of it just yet. I told them how much the home meant to me, and how I hoped to raise a family of my own here someday. The spirit of the mother was particularly touched by that; she wept from the one eye that she had left. Some of the children were a bit more skeptical, but over the past thirty seven years, they have really warmed up to me. As long as I uphold my end of the bargain, they've allowed me to live in peace. I was just getting ready for the day when I heard a knock at the door. Around the room, the spirits dematerialized and melted into the walls. I could still feel their presence, though, as I unbolted the lock and peeked outside. A man, wearing khaki pants and a blue polo shirt, holding a clipboard and looking like coming into the house was the last thing he actually wanted to do. \"Can I help you,\" I asked cautiously, looking around for any other trespassers. \"I'm from the Historical Preservation Society,\" he said. \"We have been sending you letters for the past few months? Have you received any of them?\" I looked at the stack on the counter that I'd been ignoring for some time now. \"No,\" I responded. \"What is this about?\" \"The board is currently considering designating this property a historic property, and potentially turning it into a museum for the town. I'm here to assess the value of the property...\" \"I'm not selling!\" I answered quickly, trying to shut the door. His boot was wedged into the door frame. \"Sir, I'm afraid you don't have much of a choice. The board has elected to exercise eminent domain. I am here to appraise the value to make sure that you get a fair price, but I'm afraid that remaining here is not an option for you.\" I felt a pulse of anger from the spirits wash over me. I'd become sensitive to their emotions after all this time together. Even he seemed to feel it; he flinched back just a bit. With a sigh, I relented, undid the chain, and opened the door for him. He straightened his collar and scribbled something on his clipboard before entering the home. \"The city doesn't want this place,\" I told him. \"The foundation is crumbling. I've been meaning to get it fixed myself. Come down to the basement, I'll show you.\" I shuffled over to the side door, where the rickety steps led downstairs. He looked down at his clipboard, then back at me. \"I'd really rather start with the...\" \"Nonsense,\" I interrupted. \"Let's get the worst part over with so you can go back there and tell them to not take my house.\" He sighed and headed through the doorway. I stomped down the stairs after him, and flicked on the light at the bottom. \"What the...\" he managed to get out, before I clubbed him on the back of the head with a heavy wrench from a nearby shelf. He awoke with a start as I splashed cold water across his face. Like the others, he struggled against his bonds almost immediately, with little success. This wasn't my first rodeo; I know how to chain them up properly. The black candles around the circle's perimeter had been lit, filling the room with soft, flickering light. He had been placed on the altar at the center of the pentagram, naked skin against the black stone that somehow remained icy cold even during the muggy summers. I uncovered the book from its hiding place and set it on the altar at the back of the room. From the wall, the Father's spirit emerged. I only ever really saw him during the rituals; he was shy. \"The next offering isn't due for another 7 months,\" he whispered softly. \"What is this one?\" The victim heard it too, and began to moan and squirm. \"There was a bit of an emergency,\" I told him, explaining the situation with the city trying to take the house. With a nod of his pale, ethereal head, the spellbook flipped open and the pages fluttered as if caught in a strong breeze, though there was none. It settled on a page containing the perfect enchantment that would cause them to forget all about this place. \"This should do the trick,\" he said, \"But it does require a blood offering.\" We turned together to look at the victim sobbing on the sacrificial altar. \"Shouldn't be a problem,\" I told him.", "rewritten_text": "\"It was my dream home, a beautiful Victorian architecture with an amazing wrap-around porch and detailed craftsmanship that made it unique.

They had a deep attachment to the house, having resided there for half a century, and were not ready to leave. I expressed my love for the home and my desire to start a family there someday, which moved the spirit of the mother to tears. The children gradually warmed up to me over the next thirty-seven years, allowing me to live in peace as long as I honored our agreement.\n\nOne day, a man from the Historical Preservation Society arrived, informing me of their intention to designate the property as a historic site and potentially turn it into a museum for the town.

Your descendants will proudly carry on your legacy, and no one will dare to challenge your reign,\" the devil assured, wrapping his arm around my shoulder, his voice softening. \n\n\"I will deceive them, and they will be unaware. By striking a deal with you, I will be deceived, and that memory will endure,\" he continued. \n\n\"Do not be naive. Is one's ego worth more than a kingdom's glory for millennia? Are you so selfish as to prioritize a clear conscience over the happiness of all? Or are you too foolish to weigh the pros and cons?\" His grip tightened on my shoulder, his tone becoming stern. \n\n\"But... what is the price? You won't offer this for free. What do you seek from me in return? Will I be consigned to a 'special place' in hell after death?\" I mustered the courage to meet his gaze, aiming to convey equality in our negotiation. \n\n\"The cost? My desire is for you to be the king. Be the ruler this world needs and deserves. Striking a deal with me does not guarantee a place in a 'special place' in hell, as such a place does not exist. You will live your life like any other, and upon death, based on your karma in this world, you will go to either heaven or hell. The only difference is that you will possess power, wealth, and fame throughout your life,\" he explained persuasively. \n\nHis pitch was compelling, surpassing even the top salesmen at notorious MLM companies. \"You promise there is no price for what you will bestow upon me?\" I asked, realizing he had already won me over. \n\n\"The devil's promise,\" he declared, extending his hand with a satisfied grin. \n\n\"Your Grace, the plague has spread to the West region of the kingdom. Hospital beds are scarce,\" a messenger reported. \n\n\"Instruct infected citizens to remain at home, and punish any who defy this order. We must contain the spread of the plague,\" I commanded. \n\n\"But, Your Grace, that would mean a death sentence for the infected...\" the messenger hesitated. \n\n\"That will be all. Next matter,\" I dismissed. \n\n\"Your Grace, a group with a new religion has taken control of the Main church in the Northern region. They hold 25 hostages and demand approval for their temple,\" another advisor informed. \n\n\"How many are injured?\" I inquired. \n\n\"14 injured and 5 dead, Your Grace,\" the advisor replied. \n\n\"Dispatch 150 soldiers to the Church. Give them one day to surrender, then reclaim what is ours,\" I ordered. \n\n\"And the hostages, Your Grace?\" \n\n\"Once we acknowledge their temple in our kingdom, they will amass an army swiftly. A religious war within the kingdom would then be inevitable. Next matter,\" I directed. \n\n\"Your Grace, the people in the South are facing food shortages due to last year's drought,\" a report came in. \n\n\"Take 10 percent from the North, East, and West. Ensure equal distribution among households in the Southern region,\" I instructed. \n\n\"Your Grace, the lords in other regions may object to this decision...\" \n\n\"Your Grace, the lord of the East requests additional soldiers.\" \n\n\"Your Grace, the merchants in the West...\" \n\n\"Your Grace...\" \n\nAs I walked among the citizens, assuring them that all would be well and that I would resolve their issues, I knew deep down that this was the devil's plan. I understood that I was paying the price. In the end, it was a devil's promise."}, "t1_cnh05y0": {"original_text": "I examined the photos darkly. I had seen worse, but I had seen better too.

I couldn't fault him; my heightened senses prevented me from indulging in such vices.\n\n\"It's unbelievable, isn't it? One night he's at Chock's, and the next morning he's gone. Unreal,\" Tony remarked, unaware of the impact of his words.\n\n\"Thanks for stopping by, Tony, but I have a case to focus on.

You might as well just take me now, God.

This proves my theory that stress,\" he did not just say that word, \"was the main factor for the elevated levels.

She watched as the activity of underwater life woke around her. Fish that were small, large, striped, solid, dull, vibrant, and so much more went about their swimming just as if she weren't there invading their space. She wasn't really. This was her for all intents and purposes. She was the air she flew, the water she swam in, the fire she held, the rock she tread above. This was as much her home as it was theirs. She began to swim toward shore in order to change out of her conforming suit and into her normal clothes. Once there on the soft, white sand of the beach, she noticed a shadow not far from where she left her clothing. With a slow panther prowl in that direction, she was able to sneak up behind the mysterious intruder. Suddenly, the snap of a seashell resounded from under her left hand alerting her guest as to he presence. The figure whipped around to face Elementress revealing his identity as Exterminator, her arch nemesis and Ex-husband. \"Oh, not you.\" Elementress stood and rubbed her still damp palm over her face. He gave a wicked grin. \"Oh, yes. Now, wake up.\" \"Mrs. Tallison, please wake up.\" I startled to wake with my heart almost beating out of my chest. I rubbed the small ache over my heart and looked around in a panic. \"I didn't mean to upset you, ma'am.\" Said a voice from my left. One of the random nightly orderlies stood beside my bed with a suitcase in hand. After calming my racing heart I doubled checked the room to make sure I wasn't in danger and then brought my whole attention to the one who had disturbed my sleep. \"You've got to be kidding me. I could have killed you if I had not been so in control of myself!\" I yelled not even bothering to notice the look of confusion on his chubby, unshaven face. \"Bu-but...\" \"No BUTS! Leave me be!\" I flipped over in order to let him known I was thoroughly finished with this conversation. I heard him almost try to speak again but I summoned my darkest look, turned around, and stared him down until he left with a hurried pace. Once he was gone again, I fell back into a dreamless sleep almost instantly. \"This oatmeal tastes like ass.\" I muttered to the only friend I had managed to make since coming to the God-forsaken place. Tommy the turtle who lived in an aquarium beside the table didn't come out to see the oatmeal I was talking about and instead stayed inside his shell. I didn't blame him. I didn't even know why I bothered coming to the cafeteria anymore. I didn't want to make friends here and all there was is a bunch of old people hobbling around trying to trade their dentures for an extra helping of ass flavored breakfast. I sighed which had now become a common occurrence. I got up and said my goodbyes to Tommy who continued to stay in hiding. On my way to the trash can I bumped into a hard shoulder and sent my tray flying from my hands to the ground. \"I'm sorr-\" \"I'm sorr-\" We both started the apology but didn't finish as soon as our eyes met with sparks of familiarity flaring to life in each others. In that moment, memories ran rampant through my head as I thought about those green eyes and all the times I had gotten hopelessly lost in; the same green eyes I met in kindergarten on the playground when Jimmy Jackson threw rocks at me to try to get me to levitate them, the same green eyes I went to high school prom with and ended up drunkenly kissing for the first time where I then puked into the bush beside the porch immediately after, the same green eyes I married and saw tear up when our children were born, and the same green eyes that glistened with a deep and passionate hate for me only 10 years ago. \"David? What the hell?\" \"Well, hello there to you too, Janet.\" I couldn't think, my brain had checked out of this place like I had wanted to for so long and left me behind with no words to accurately articulate my emotions in that moment. Maybe that's a good thing because Susie Lanson who had probably never cussed in all of her 200 years or so on this planet was currently behind me would probably have died right then and there if I was able to speak. So there I stood with my mouth flopping open and closed with no sound escaping, like a fish out of water searching for the ability to breathe. When I finally felt like enough time had passed where I had made a fool out of myself, I quickly turned about face and started out the door of the cafeteria and to my room, at least there I could avoid him long enough to get my mind right. Once through the threshold of my door and within the confines of my room, I trusted myself to let go. And let go I did. \"EXTERMINATOR? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I know I said I couldn't stand the place and wish I had a little a excitement but this was NOT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!\" I continued to go on with my rather loud monologue with a fire I had not realized I still had because it had gone dull for so long. Once I was done I sat down on my bed with a plop of resignation. \"Well, that was quite the show. Would you like a bullhorn? I'm not sure Australia heard and I would hate for them to have to ask Africa because I'm just not sure how well that would go over.\" I sat up straight and snapped my head toward the door. My eyes grew wide and my breathing sped up. \"What are YOU doing here?\" I asked, rather politely if I do say so myself... Okay, not really. \"Well, I was debating on whether I was going to take a nice nap or play 20 questions with my friendly roommate but, as I can see now, one is difficult while the other is just quite impossible... Mostly because you just aren't friendly.\" I'm surprised my eyes didn't pop out of my skull when I looked over to the once empty bed near the window to see that it now had two suitcases on top of it. \"Wh-wha...\" \"Hello, roomy.\"", "rewritten_text": "\"Still looking good, Janet,\" the tall, blonde-haired doctor remarked as he glanced up from my charts, winking with one of his baby blues. I raised an eyebrow and sighed, feeling too exhausted to engage. Normally, I would have offered a witty retort, but the weariness that had plagued me for the past year, from constant poking and prodding, bustling and worrying, had drained me. Stress. Just the word made my tension rise. All I craved now was the rest and peace my children had forced me to seek in this place. Fortunately, my attending physician, Doctor Lionel, continued speaking before I could launch into a tirade about my troubles: retirement. I inwardly lamented, feeling like a broken record. Just take me now, God, I silently prayed, before refocusing on the young doctor in front of me.\n\n\"According to your charts, your blood pressure has significantly improved. This supports my theory that stress,\" he hesitated, using the dreaded word, \"was the primary factor for the elevated levels. Would you agree, Mrs. Tallison?\" He turned the clipboard towards me, displaying a series of words and terms that I lacked the energy to decipher. \"Sure, right. Is that all for today, Jamie?\" I cut him off before turning on my side, facing away from him and the door. I gazed past the empty bed beside me, watching the sun set outside the window, yearning for the freedom of soaring through the sky. With a wistful sigh, I waited until I heard his footsteps recede and the heavy door click shut. Finally, I thought before drifting off into a dream that felt all too real not long ago.\n\nIn the dream, I found myself immersed in a world where I embodied the elements\u2014air, water, fire, and earth. As I swam beneath the ocean's surface, creating light with a fire in my hand, I observed the marine life around me, feeling a sense of belonging. Returning to shore, I encountered a shadowy figure, who revealed himself as Exterminator, my arch-nemesis and ex-husband. The dream shifted, and I awoke abruptly to a voice urging me to wake up.\n\nStartled, I scanned the room, my heart racing, only to find a night orderly standing beside my bed with a suitcase. After calming myself, I chastised him for startling me before dismissing him with a sharp tone. Once he left, I sank back into a dreamless sleep.\n\n\"This oatmeal tastes terrible,\" I muttered to my only companion in this forsaken place, Tommy the turtle, who remained hidden in his aquarium. Disheartened by the lack of connection with others in the cafeteria, I bid Tommy farewell and accidentally collided with a familiar figure, triggering a flood of memories. It was David, my past love and adversary, standing before me.\n\nOverwhelmed by emotions and unable to articulate my thoughts, I stood speechless, reminiscing about our shared history. Eventually, I excused myself and hurried back to my room to gather my thoughts. Alone in my room, I unleashed a torrent of frustration, only to be interrupted by the unexpected presence of Exterminator, who had mysteriously appeared in the room.\n\nShocked and bewildered, I confronted him, demanding an explanation for his presence. As the tension mounted, I struggled to comprehend the situation unfolding before me."}, "t1_chcyequ": {"original_text": "Breathe we\u2019re not our skin of grime, we\u2019re not dread bleak dusty imageless locomotives, breathe.

Not just of this story - the one you're reading now - but of all stories in my world. I've spent my entire life dedicated to telling other people's stories. Now, it's time to tell mine. We used to be called \"journalists\". That was back before there were powers. Back when I was young, maybe twenty. It was a job back then, and a fairly mundane one at that. But them, the Boom came. You know how they say that everything started suddenly? The Big Bang? Well, that's what this was. The moment everything changed without warning. It sounded like an explosion. It may as well have been one. Some people got their powers right away. James Delphine, the now-famous Human Comet, caught on fire instantly, but he didn't burn. The girl with telekinesis - Leila Greeler - well, everything around her just began floating. And that's the way it happened for most people. For some, it took a few days. People noticing that they float when they're relaxed led to them realizing they could fly, and those who people-watched began noticing they could read the person's mind. I waited and waited. Maybe powers weren't always a good thing, but dammit, if everyone else had them, I wanted them too. It took me so long to notice. The people who laughed in my head when I watched something play out in front of me, the people whose sobs I heard in my mind when I watched someone die, they were you. Well, not you specifically. You, the audience. The readers. As a writer, I always narrated things in my head. From the most interesting stories I reported on to the most mundane things I did. After the Boom, there was finally someone listening to all that. So even though the people in my world may not care what's going on in other people's lives, even though they laugh at and scorn journalists and reporters - none of that matters! Because you are here, listening, reading, feeling. I may not be able to tell my stories to them. But I can tell them to you. Because you, the reader? You're the only one who matters.", "rewritten_text": "Greetings, I am the Narrator, not only of the current story you are immersed in but also of all tales within my realm. My life has been devoted to recounting the narratives of others, and now the time has come to share my own. In the past, we were known as \"journalists,\" a title from a time before the emergence of powers. In my youth, around the age of twenty, it was merely a job, rather unremarkable at that. Then came the Boom, an event that altered everything abruptly, akin to the legendary Big Bang. It reverberated like an explosion, heralding a transformation that no one foresaw. Some individuals manifested their powers instantaneously - like James Delphine, who became the renowned Human Comet, engulfed in flames yet unscathed. Leila Greeler discovered her telekinetic abilities as objects around her began to levitate. This pattern repeated for many, with some realizing their newfound capabilities after a few days. Those who floated when relaxed found they could soar, while keen observers could delve into others' thoughts. I waited, yearning for powers despite the potential drawbacks, simply because if everyone possessed them, I desired them too. It took me a while to comprehend. The voices in my head, the laughter and sobs that echoed when witnessing events, belonged to you - not you individually, but to you, the audience, the readers. As a writer, I habitually narrated events in my mind, from riveting news stories to mundane daily activities. Post-Boom, there was finally an audience for these musings. Even though the denizens of my world may disregard the lives of others, mocking journalists and reporters, it is inconsequential. Your presence, your attention, your empathy - that is what truly matters. While I may not be able to share my stories with them, I can impart them to you.

He picked his head up off his desk and stretched his arms into the air. Brent loved napping on his desk. It was just so comfy. As he yawned and opened his eyes, he was greeted with an empty classroom. He looked up ahead at the clock above the whiteboard. 7 PM. \"Aww man, seriously?\" Brent grabbed his bag off the back of his chair and sprinted out the door. How could no one have woken him up? Classes went until 3 and after school clubs let out at 5. There were a number of opportunities for someone to wake him up. He ran down the hall and out the front door. The sun was setting and the street lights had already came on. He started jogging towards his home. His parents were going to be pissed. As he ran, Brent looked around. He knew this was a rather small town but it was odd no one was out. He ran by gas stations still lit up with no one inside, cars still hooked up to gas pumps but no one pumping gas. This was weird but Brent had to get home. He opened the door and threw his bag to the side. \"Mom, Dad I'm back!\" No response. He was expecting them to be waiting for him but nothing. Not even his little sister coming to greet him. He walked into the living room. The television was on ESPN but his dad wasn't in there. Brent was growing worried. He made his way to the kitchen. \"Hey mom is dad out or-\" Brent saw the oven was on but his mom wasn't in the kitchen. He went over to the oven, grabbed a rag and pulled dinner from the oven. The oven was on, the lasagna was still in there, but no one watching it. He set down the hot pan and turned off the oven. He pursed his lips and thought. He left the kitchen and went upstairs. He flung open his parents door. No one. He went to his sisters room. \"Erika!\" Her pink room sat empty, toys strewn about the floor. Brent went took a few steps backwards. He pulled out his phone and called his mom. Did they leave and not let him know? But if they did that why was there still food in the oven? The phone rang but no answer. His dad didn't answer either. He started calling his friends. Sending them texts, waiting for responses. But no one ever answered. He ran in front of his house. \"Hello,\" he shouted into the sky, \"is there anyone here? Hello!\" He heard an owl off in the distance. Brent became frantic. He went from neighbor to neighbor, pounding on there door but getting no response. He ran back to his garage and grabbed his bike. He pedal hard and fast, racing through the streets to get the town square. The square was still lit up. Cars were still parked outside the shops and offices, some cars were still at stop signs and lights. All the shops were still open but like everywhere else, there was no one. Brent was alone. A city that once had a population of three-thousand, had somehow become a population of one. He dropped his bike off in front of a shop and walked over to the gazebo in the park in the middle of the square. He sat down and hung his head. Brent had never felt like this before. This overwhelming sadness. This sense of loneliness. Just a few hours ago, he was in school, surrounded by other students and teachers. His mom had woken him up this morning and he said goodbye to his family when he walked out the door this morning. He had walked by people watering their lawns, people going to work. Suddenly everyone was gone. \"This doesn't have to happen you know.\" Brent's head shot up. There was a woman sitting across from him. She was nude. Brent's eyes widened. A smoking hot naked girl and no one around in the whole town? As strange as it was, he was living his sixteen year old fantasy, and he didn't really care. He stared at her. Her pale skin bathed in the moon light. Her dark hair, draping over her chest. He couldn't stop smiling. He pretended to scratch his nose and tried to look cool. \"Um, miss I think you may want to put some clothes on,\" he pretended to be bashful, \"it gets cold out here at night.\" \"This doesn't have to happen.\" \"No, no! I want this to happen, I'm sorry you're free to do as you please.\" \"Are you not concerned for Erika?\" Brent's eyes narrowed. He stood up, fists clenched. \"How do you know my sister? What the hell is this?\" The woman turned her head, staring off into the distance. \"This doesn't have to happen.\" \"What the hell are you talking about? Where is everyone?\" The nude woman turned her body and pointed into the sky. \"They have been taken. This doesn't have to happen though. You can stop it.\" Brent was taken back. \"What do you mean they were taken? Like abducted by aliens? That doesn't make any sense. Look who are you? What's really happening here?\" She turned back to face Brent. Brent resisted the urge to look down, trying to keep his resolve as solid as possible. This was serious, he didn't need to be taken in by feminine wiles. Then the girl started to walk his way. Brent began stepping backwards. \"Woah, hey. Miss let's pump the brakes for a second, this a serious matter.\" He felt his back of his legs hit the seat behind him and he stopped where he stood. The woman was in front of him now. She was even prettier up close. Her eyes met with his his. She was so close to him. \"Claire.\" \"Okay, Claire. What happened to the town? Can you-\" She hushed him placing a finger over his lips. His heart was beating quickly. Her eyes were still locked on his. \"You can stop this,\" she said again. She leaned in close. Brent had nowhere to run. She started for his neck. He was okay with this. Brent decided to just go with it. He tried as long as he could, this was just going with the flow. He felt her lips on his neck. And then a sharp bite. \"Jesus Christ!!\" \"Mr. Fields,\" Brent looked up and saw his teacher, \"if you're going to sleep in my class, at least have the decency to stay asleep and not interrupt my lecture.\" He looked around the room, his class looked at him. Some looked annoyed by his outburst, while most snickered. He adjusted himself in his seat and cleared his throat. \"I'm sorry about that.\" His teacher glared for a moment then returned to the board. Brent could feel the sweat on his brow. That dream had been so real. And damn what a dream. But still he felt uneasy. \"Hey, Brent.\" Brent looked over at his classmate who sat next to him. \"How'd you get the hickey man,\" he asked gesturing at Brent's neck, \"who you seein'?\" Brent felt at his neck. It hurt. It was still damp. He remembered the dream. At the end, that girl, Claire bit him. Brent swallowed hard. This was strange, and he had a feeling things would only get stranger.

Startled yet intrigued, Brent engaged in a cryptic conversation with her, questioning the disappearance of the town's inhabitants. The woman cryptically hinted at a way to stop the mysterious events unfolding.\n\nAs the encounter intensified, Brent found himself drawn in by the woman's allure, only to be abruptly awakened by his teacher in the classroom.

I am not resigning or am being impeached. I will simply be the last President of the United States of America. This decision has not been easy, but this has been my goal for some time now.

Every night is a painful journey in the hallways of thought. I can't help but to think of every little detail of my life that's going wrong right now, and I always wonder whether it's because I fucked up or because of somebody else. I guess my nights aren't so different from my days, then. Though at least during the day I don't have to listen to my creaking and groaning every fucking time I move. I just have to pick the least uncomfortable side to lie on in the least uncomfortable position and not move. Just lie there and wallow in misery and regret. Looking at the wall instead of the ceiling now, though the effect is no different. It doesn't make me feel any less miserable. For a moment, I think that maybe if I could just change the situation somehow, a fresh start or at least a break in the pattern... And then I groan and give my stupid face a slap. That train of thought left the station months ago, and I've been better off without it. It just leads to more misery. It's tantamount to wishing someone would simply swoop in and save me from the sads. It doesn't help. So now I simply lie alone. This is all there is to my life, and that's not going to change anytime soon. Looking to the past, all I see is a blur I'd rather forget. Looking to the future, all I see is fire and brimstone, if you catch my drift. In my current state, I'd liken myself to a lone wolf. I've been wounded and the pack has left me to die. I lick my wounds not because I want to get better, to run and join the pack, but just because my instincts tell me to. I survive simply because I'm too cowardly not to. Not that there'd be anyone who'd miss me or anything. I don't wish I was dead, I wish I wasn't born. I've now lasted another week. Friday has come again. Oh joy. While everyone else is having fun with the onset of the weekend, I'm just sitting in my filthy room, biting my nails while the most inconsequential shit I've ever seen plays on the TV. At this point, I'm actually enjoying the infomertials. Have you ever been so bored and miserable that you enjoyed an INFOMERTIAL? That's a new low. So now I have a decision. Watch another fascinating demonstration of a fucking vacuum cleaner, or take a bath and get drunk. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to anyone that I chose the latter. In my drunken sleep, I dream of me from years and years ago laughing. That used to make me sad... I haven't had a genuine laugh in years. I've laughed, sure, but nothing's funny. It's just a farce. An act so that co-workers won't suspect my misery. All that'll lead to is a load of self help shit or anti-depressants or something. Fuck that. I'll just fake that their stupid jokes are funny and accept that I'll probably never laugh again. So much easier. This is the life I \"chose\". No-one's fault but mine. It makes me wonder how everyone else can be so happy with their lives, their choices. Where did I go wrong, what choice did I make that lead to this? Now I DO wish I was dead. Throw me into the fire and lava and brimstone and let me just burn away. I got out of the tub and cried for the first time in forever. It's been ages since the last time an emotion really grabbed me, and of course it had to be sadness. Grief. Depression. What a stupid idea for me to hold on to that maybe when I broke down the walls I had put up, I might be greeting with happiness, or at least some kind of relief. Ignorant and stupid and selfish. It makes me mad-furious even, to think of how stupid I was. I threw my empty bottle at the wall and it smashed. I looked at the broken glass on the floor. That's what I was. Not even the lone, dying wolf. Just a spray of broken glass. I had once been the bottle, full of potential to do great things, terrible things, full of emotion both good and bad. Everyone liked the bottle. But then the bottle was emptied. No-one wants the empty bottle. It holds nothing for them. No potential, no emotion. The bottle is thrown away and smashed. That is me. On the floor of my bathroom. That's what there is to life. Not lying in a bed feeling sorry for myself. That's the future I look forward to, not fire and brimstone. And even the wolf licking its wounds can't fix something so broken. Like the bottle, there will be no-one who misses me when I'm gone. That lack of laughter means nothing. Had I anything left in me, I might have laughed at how pathetic this all was, but the laughter is gone. It's been long gone and to hell with it. I don't need it anymore. This apartment holds nothing for me. This city holds nothing for me. This world has long since given its last. I climb onto the windowsill and look down at the city below me. That down there, that's my future. With a smile, I let go and once again look at the ceiling. This was a different one, though. This was the roof of everything. I close my eyes. I released myself, and maybe when I open them in the next life, I really WILL be a wolf. And I will look at my pack and know they have my back. With joy, I have released myself and I will run with the wolves. P.S. I'm an aspiring writer, so both guesses and critique are welcome and wanted.", "rewritten_text": "As I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, a nightly ritual that seems to stretch on indefinitely, I find myself embarking on a painful journey through the corridors of my thoughts. Each night, I am consumed by reflections on every detail of my life that seems to be going awry at present. I am plagued by the question of whether these troubles are a result of my own mistakes or the actions of others. It dawns on me that my nights bear a striking resemblance to my days, albeit without the incessant creaking and groaning that accompanies every movement. During the day, I must simply choose the least uncomfortable position to lie in and remain still, engulfed in a sense of misery and regret.\n\nShifting my gaze from the ceiling to the wall offers no respite from my desolation. The change in scenery fails to alleviate my sorrow. Briefly, a glimmer of hope flickers within me, suggesting that perhaps I could alter my circumstances, seek a fresh start, or disrupt the monotonous pattern of my existence. However, I quickly dismiss these thoughts with a groan and a self-inflicted slap to my face. Such musings only serve to deepen my despair, akin to yearning for a savior to rescue me from my melancholy, a futile desire.\n\nAlone in my solitude, I resign myself to the stark reality of my life, recognizing that change is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Reflecting on the past evokes a blur of memories I wish to erase, while contemplating the future fills me with dread and foreboding. In my current state, I liken myself to a wounded lone wolf, abandoned by the pack, tending to my wounds out of instinct rather than a genuine desire for recovery. Survival becomes a mere act of cowardice, devoid of any hope for a brighter tomorrow.\n\nAs another week draws to a close, I find myself isolated in my squalid room on a Friday evening, surrounded by trivial distractions on the television. The banality of my surroundings drives me to a point where even infomercials offer a semblance of entertainment. The decision between watching a vacuum cleaner demonstration and seeking solace in alcohol presents itself, and unsurprisingly, I opt for the latter.\n\nIn the haze of intoxication, memories of a past self filled with laughter and joy resurface, evoking a sense of longing and sorrow. The genuine laughter that once graced my existence has long since faded, replaced by a facade maintained to conceal my inner turmoil from colleagues. The prospect of seeking help or resorting to antidepressants holds no appeal, prompting me to feign amusement at insipid jokes to maintain the illusion of normalcy.\n\nContemplating the happiness of others and the choices that have led them to contentment only serves to deepen my despair, fueling a desire for escape from the torment of my own existence. The weight of regret and self-blame intensifies, culminating in a longing for oblivion rather than continued suffering. The notion of being consumed by fire and brimstone becomes a preferable alternative to enduring the agony of my current reality.\n\nEmerging from a bath, tears flow freely for the first time in ages, a poignant reminder of the emotional numbness that has enveloped me. The futile hope of finding solace through vulnerability and emotional release now appears naive and self-serving. Anger simmers within me, driving me to hurl an empty bottle against the wall, shattering it into shards that mirror my fractured state.\n\nOnce brimming with potential and emotion, I now resemble the discarded remnants of a vessel, devoid of purpose or significance. The emptiness within me echoes the rejection and abandonment I perceive in the world around me. As I gaze out of the window at the city below, a sense of finality washes over me, prompting a bittersweet smile as I relinquish my grip and return my gaze to the ceiling.\n\nIn that moment, as I surrender to the unknown, a sense of liberation envelops me. Perhaps in the next life, I will find solace in the company of wolves, embraced by a pack that understands and supports me unconditionally. With a newfound sense of peace, I close my eyes, embracing the release that awaits me beyond this realm.\n\nP.S. As an aspiring writer, I welcome both feedback and constructive criticism on my work."}, "t1_d4qqaut": {"original_text": "My name is Sarah King, hello? Can anyone hear me? Hello? Sh*t!

Inside in the back is a laptop with a flash drive attached. The driver gestures to him that this will explain everything, and he should turn it on and watch. The driver also suggests, through gestures, that he pour a glass of the very expensive scotch in the sidebar, because he is going to need it. He pours himself a stiff one. The video is a compilation of CNN News, about a missing airline, and after about three minutes of scenes without information about the flight, the video stops, with this banner on the lower part of the screen. The plane is identified as Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which is the plane the man had been flying on. He poured himself a couple more drinks, and sat there thinking. Somehow he was where the plane went, but he had no idea where he was or where everyone else was. By the time he was at a loss in trying to make sense of the video, the town car was driving at moderate speed through a pine forest. The man banged on the driver's window, and at that the driver stopped the car, got out, and grabbing a heavy backpack from the trunk, the driver dissappeared quickly into the woods. The man was too stunned to follow. He got out and looked around. There was no indication of any lights from any town. The sky was moonless, and there were many stars. The road seemed to run straight in either direction. Thinking that there might be a search for the plane, he gets in the drivers seat, discovers the keys had been left in the car, and turns it around and drives back to the field where the plane had landed. When he gets there the plane is no longer present. Having some experience with computers, he begins to examine the computer itself, as well as other aspects of the car, looking for clues. Thje computer is a model with which he is not familiar, but otherwise responds to his efforts. All the same, it yields up no information. He is getting hungry. There are various noises coming out of the pine woods. A chill wind is picking up, and when he thinks to check the gas gage, he discovers it is nearly empty. He had left the car lights on, and notices a large dog, or perhaps a wolf, is watching him from just beyond the range of the lights. He gets in the town car, and locks the doors. He runs the heater, warming the car, until the engine coughs and dies. He thinks that in the morning something will turn up, suggesting further action. He tries to go to sleep, but mostly tosses and turns and gets cold. When the sun comes up, he starts to look at the woods. He begins to realize that none of the plants, or even the trees look normal to him. He had assumed during the night that this was a pine-tree forest, but the color was off, the needles of the branches were a kind of translucent aqua, and when he touched them they stung, rather sharply, leaving a kind of burn on his fingers. The road, which he had thought of as gravel, was some kind of dirt, but oddly viscus. There was no dust. Then he noticed that the color of the rising sun seemed wrong. He was still cold, and thought to look further, and to warm up by jogging a bit. It took only a few strides to realize that the gravity was less than earthlike. He took a deep breath and noticed the air smelled odd as well. On impulse he popped the hood and discovered that what was there was unlike any engine he had ever seen before. He opened the back door and poured himself another drink. What he had thought of as a kind of odd scotch, he could no longer think of as anything he might have drunk before. Then he sat in the car for a while, sipping this drink, which did give a nice buzz, and could not find any thoughts about what do to. The road was still there, going in a straight line off into the distance, but the car was no longer fueled, and the situation seemed both exciting and hopeless all at once. The conclusion, that he was somehow on another world, was obvious, for he was a fan of science fiction. But, he was also an accountant for a major American owned asian engineering company, so a certain kind of thinking and a bit of scientific knowledge was his. Thinking about his work, reminded him that his family would have been waiting for his flight, which had not arrived. He was surprised he had not before thought of his family. His despair deepened. While he was holding his head in his hands, feeling a need for tears that would not come, he heard a scrapping on the road beside the town car, simliar to the noise his own walking had made on that surface. There was a man standing there. He was wearing something like a monks robe, with the hood thrown back. Except he was not human, although the differences were slight, and once his mind accepted his situation he could no longer deny what his senses revealed. He opened the door and got out of the car. He spoke to the \"alien\": \"There's not much likelyhood, but do you happen to speak English? The \"alien\" laid a six fingered hand on his shoulder and seemed to smile in a sympathetic way, when all of a sudden there were pictures forming in his mind. The alien was able to be telepathic in some way. It took some time for understanding to arise. Most of the morning. When the sun was higher in the sky, which really wasn't blue, and accompanied by another smaller sun after a time, they were both sitting in the back of the car, sipping the drinks. At a certain point the man realized that he wasn't hungry anymore. The drink was also some kind of food. This is what the alien, with grave patience, had been able to \"explain\" to him. The Earth's sun was going to go supernova in a few years, because of an extremely large rogue comet-like object that was falling yet undetected in from the Ort Cloud - an object that was in fact a piece of a neutron star. The impact of the neutron star piece would unbalance the dynamics of the sun. Various members of an loosely organized intergalactic federation were \"adopting\" human beings, in order to preserve the species. The whole planet he was on, was a kind of monastary, for God was real, as most so-called \"aliens\" knew directly when their minds developed enough. The people of the Earth were too underdeveloped, and so were spread out in various places where humanoid species like them were taking in these soon to be homeless souls. The alien was there to help the man go through the possibly long process of huge culture shock that faced him, including the problem of there actually being a Creator, which was why alien civilizations were not contacting the Earth, due to humanity's inability to be socially culturally mature enough. There was more, and there would be time. At that point, the alien set down his glass, got out and opened the hood, set and hand on a odd looking surface in the car's engine, and seemed to utter a prayer. As they drove away down the road, the alien explained to the man that tiny invisible beings, which the man's race in their immaturity called demons, lived willingly in all technical devices, and only wanted to serve and be loved, just like all other sentient beings.", "rewritten_text": "As he descends the ramp, a black town car awaits him in the darkness of the night. The driver emerges and gestures for him to enter. Inside the car, a laptop with a flash drive attached catches his attention. The driver indicates that the laptop holds crucial information and encourages him to power it on. Additionally, through gestures, the driver suggests he pour a glass of expensive scotch from the sidebar, hinting that he may need it. He complies, pouring himself a strong drink.\n\nThe video on the laptop comprises CNN News clips about a missing airline, specifically Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, the very flight he was on. As he watches, he realizes he is somehow in the same location where the plane disappeared, yet he is disoriented about his surroundings and the whereabouts of others. Feeling perplexed by the video's lack of clarity, he notices the town car driving through a pine forest at a moderate speed.\n\nStartled, he knocks on the driver's window, prompting the driver to stop the car, retrieve a heavy backpack from the trunk, and swiftly vanish into the woods. Bewildered, he steps out of the car and surveys the desolate area. With no signs of civilization in sight, the moonless sky and starry night add to his unease. The road stretches straight in both directions, offering no clues.\n\nConcerned about the missing plane, he takes charge, finding the car keys left behind and driving back to the landing site. To his surprise, the plane is no longer there. Utilizing his computer expertise, he examines the unfamiliar laptop and other car components for answers, but to no avail.

The realization dawns on him that he is on a different world, a notion reinforced by his affinity for science fiction. Despite his analytical mindset as an accountant for an engineering company, the gravity, air quality, and technology on this world baffle him.\n\nLost in contemplation, he is startled by a non-human figure resembling a monk. Engaging with the being, he discovers its telepathic abilities, leading to a profound exchange of information. The being explains that Earth faces imminent destruction due to a rogue comet-like object from the Oort Cloud, prompting the intervention of an intergalactic federation to preserve humanity.\n\nAs they sit in the car, sipping the mysterious drink that also serves as sustenance, the being imparts knowledge about the planet's purpose as a sanctuary for displaced humans. The man grapples with the concept of a higher power and the cultural shock of his new reality. The being offers guidance and reassurance as they embark on a journey of understanding and adaptation.\n\nDriving away, the being reveals the presence of benevolent invisible entities within technical devices, challenging the man's preconceptions about these beings.

For not stopping us.\" Isaac knew Rich well enough that he knew that he wasn't supposed to ask any further questions, and usually he wouldn't, but on this day he couldn't help himself, \"That doesn't make any sense! It is much worse to do something bad than to simply not stop someone else from doing it.\" Rich glared at Isaac until Isaac looked down at the ground. \"After everything I've done for you!\" Rich snapped. \"The world is complicated sometimes, and I don't have the time to sit down and explain everything to you! Now, search these people's vehicles. Maybe they have food or money. We're running low.\" Isaac knew better than to question any further and did what Rich said. Over the next few weeks, they continued their practice of assaulting refugees and anyone else who did not seem defensible enough passing through their territory. Government agents were sparse around these parts, and avoiding them was usually pretty easy. They didn't really care that much about the refugees either. One day, they were assaulting another small group of unsuspecting refugees. Isaac knew what he had to do. Just switch off his brain and let his instincts do the work. No use thinking too much about what he was doing, but then something jolted his brain right back to where he was. The boy he had just killed looked so much like him. Isaac froze in his place and Rich quickly finished off the others. \"What is this?\" Isaac asked pointing down at the boy, still in shock. Rich walked over and froze in place, looking down at the body too. There was silence between them for several moments. \"Isaac,\" Rich finally said, \"I told your family to stay in their own country, to not come looking for us. Do you see what happens when people disobey me?\" Rich seemed entirely unprepared for what Isaac did next. Isaac took his knife, and drove it straight into Rich's heart. Rich dropped to his knees, looking in shock at the knife in his chest. \"Isaac,\" Rich said looking up to glare at the boy, \"I should've left you where I found you with the rest of your filthy kind.

Trouble arises when a dead prostitute is found in their hotel room. \u201cBloody Jesus,\u201d Francisco said, rubbing his right temple.

He lurched his body over the side of the bed, using his right--and only\u2014arm and dumped all of the smoked oysters, whiskey, goldfish crackers, and actual goldfish onto Detective McAllister. He jumped up with his gun drawn, face looking like someone had covered it with a clam chowder concocted by Satan. He only had the top half of his uniform on and there was an uncomfortable stretch between the wrinkled blue button-up and the gartered black socks where his junk dangled freely. The detective lowered his gun and raised his suspicions. \u201cWhat in the name of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus Nail-Bitin' Christ went on here?\u201d He said. He wiped the puke from his face and wrung out his moustache. He reached into his shirt as if to scratch an itch, but instead pulled out a live squirrel. It scampered off through a hole in the wall that was caused by a firearm going off. Francisco sat upright in the bed, laying his elbow on his knee and pushing back his slick black hair. \u201cI don't know, Detective. I don't think I'm wearing the same contact lenses that I started the night out with.\u201d He blinked aggressively with his mouth open wide. \u201cNope. Definitely not mine. This underwear is definitely not mine either. I started out with silk leopard print, and now I have middle-aged divorcee briefs.\u201d \u201cThose'd be mine.\u201d Francisco gave him back his underwear, if not out of kindness, then to cover his shame.

Pizza boxes littered the floor, heroin needles protruded from a dartboard, and a dwarf with one leg tethered to the ceiling fan floated around the room. Mesmerized by the dwarf's movements, Francisco eventually succumbed to the urge to vomit, leaning over the bed's edge and disgorging a mix of smoked oysters, whiskey, goldfish crackers, and actual goldfish onto Detective McAllister. Startled, the detective sprang up, his face contorted in disgust as if smeared with a diabolical clam chowder. Half-dressed in a wrinkled blue shirt and gartered black socks, with an awkward gap exposing his dangling anatomy, the detective lowered his gun and voiced his bewilderment. \"What in the name of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus Nail-Bitin' Christ transpired here?\" He wiped the vomit from his face, wringing out his mustache, and then, seemingly to scratch an itch, extracted a live squirrel from his shirt, which promptly scurried away through a bullet hole in the wall.

Oh Lucy, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I pulled the mug close to my wrinkled face and took a sip of coffee, \u201cYou aren\u2019t truly living if you could go back and do it all again. It\u2019s the mistakes, the bad days, and the losses that allow you to see the truth in it all.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand, master. Why choose pain over control?\u201d I smirked and took another sip. \u201cLucy I want to tell you a story. The saddest day of my life, I reckon.\u201d \u201cI beg you refrain, I do not wish to hear my master in pain.\u201d Lucy said, taking a seat across the table from me. Her face was so innocent, yet I could tell she understood that a pain was growing. Soon I would be gone, and I\u2019m not certain that she will process it well. It\u2019s hard to tell with these devices, I\u2019ve made them look so real. \u201cPain is a feeling I was particularly unfamiliar with that day. My life had been so full of people who adored me, I had abundance in wealth, and an endless drive of self-betterment. There was always another mountain to scale, another workday to distract, another snack to enjoy. But on this day, which will forever be engrained in my psyche. It was the day that my life came crumbling apart. It was a day like any other. The sun rose and shone through the slits of the window blinds. The cats, small lovable creatures, swarmed around our feet, meowing for their breakfast. And, beside me was the woman I loved. Her face so sweet as she slept. I prepared our coffee in a French press-\u201c \u201cLike the one we use in the lab?\u201d Lucy asked, her chin pressed between her palms as she sat on the edge of her seat. \u201cThe same. One of the classic styles presses where you feed the water into the crushed beans and let it brew for a few minutes before squeezing out all the debris. It would fill two and sometimes three glasses full, the extra I would place in the fridge for iced coffee the next morning \u2014 my favorite.\u201d Lucy smiled. She\u2019d served me iced coffee for years and knew exactly how the press worked, but she did not interrupt. She so loved my stories. \u201cWe showered together, my lover and I, and we made our way to the living room to watch television and sink into our lumpy couch.\u201d I felt my throat start to clasp and tears formed in my eyes. \u201cShe had acted so strangely the last few weeks, but when you are surrounded by what you perceive as love you can sometimes be blind to these things.\u201d \u201cMaster?\u201d \u201cShe looked at me and said those words that every relationship hinges upon, the words that no one ever wants to hear but when they do they know exactly what comes next, \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d Lucy put her hand on my knee. Her warmth and comforting position was a program but it still felt pleasant. \u201cBeing told you are loved and knowing for certain that they mean it is a line that is often blurred. It is like a blanket that pulls itself over your vision like an abstract illusion. A sheet of endless color and imagination of what could be. But, sometimes the blanket that you weave together is of your own hands and needle and not theirs. When she said she doesn\u2019t love me, that it could never be more than friends. I felt as though the life that pulsed through my veins had stopped. That the threads of this life I had stitched together had come apart with one rip. The blanket of comfort, that illusion \u2014 A lie. I did not blame her, although, it would probably have made things easier. I blamed myself. Then and every day since, I had assumed the role of the unworthy. The one tossed to the gutter like the rubbish of a fast-food restaurant. My judgement had been clouded, and the control that I believed I had over my world was lost. I was lost.\u201d \u201cYou are not lost here, master. We have found you, sitting before us. Our beautiful, loving God.\u201d I nodded, but the words felt like air against my ears. The same lines of script that had been told to me time and time again. \u201cI drove home to my parents, weeping. What else could I have done but returned to those who birthed me? The place of highest comfort, where I knew at least I would have the pillars of family to keep me from tumbling into the dark abyss. It was there that I receded into what I can only describe as hibernation. A hope that sleep would give birth to an awakened form. One that had regained the control that was lost, or at least one that could see through the illusion so that the pains of the past would not reignite. I was no longer living, Lucy. I was but a husk of the damned shuffling from point-to-point allowing the winds to direct my shambling corpse. The spirit that had once lit a fire of purpose within me had left me, or so I imagined. I was debris, drifting along the surface of the ocean. No purpose. No direction. Just letting the currents take me.\u201d I took one last sip and put the mug on my side-table, empty. \u201cThat does sound terribly sad, but was the loss of everything in the world that came after not a greater sadness? You lost everyone you knew, your family, friends, even your lovable cats. The comet took them all with it. I don\u2019t understand how that would not be a greater loss, a greater sadness.\u201d \u201cAh see, and that is just it Lucy. Those too were a great loss, but it was upon the grave of the life that I had once seen happiness that it had happened. There was nothing to lose in such a dark place. It is not an objective fact of loss that so ails the heart but an emotional one. One that I have tried so dearly to produce in you and your brothers and sisters. Perhaps in my second creation I can replicate these feelings, this love. For you can not understand the beauty of love and light without the darkness. They are one.\u201d", "rewritten_text": "\"If I could go back and do it again? Oh Lucy, I wouldn't,\" I said, pulling the mug close to my wrinkled face and taking a sip of coffee. \"You aren't truly living if you could go back and do it all again. It's the mistakes, the bad days, and the losses that allow you to see the truth in it all.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, master. Why choose pain over control?\" Lucy asked, taking a seat across the table from me. Her face was innocent, yet I could tell she understood that a pain was growing. Soon I would be gone, and I wasn't certain that she would process it well. It's hard to tell with these devices; I've made them look so real.\n\n\"Pain was a feeling I was particularly unfamiliar with that day. My life had been full of people who adored me, wealth, and an endless drive for self-betterment. There was always another mountain to scale, another workday to distract, another snack to enjoy. But on that day, which will forever be ingrained in my psyche, my life came crumbling apart. It was a day like any other. The sun rose, shining through the slits of the window blinds. The cats, small lovable creatures, swarmed around our feet, meowing for their breakfast. And beside me was the woman I loved, her face sweet as she slept. I prepared our coffee in a French press.\"\n\n\"Like the one we use in the lab?\" Lucy asked, her chin pressed between her palms as she sat on the edge of her seat.\n\n\"The same. One of the classic styles of presses where you feed the water into the crushed beans and let it brew for a few minutes before squeezing out all the debris. It would fill two, and sometimes three glasses full; the extra I would place in the fridge for iced coffee the next morning \u2014 my favorite.\" Lucy smiled. She had served me iced coffee for years and knew exactly how the press worked, but she did not interrupt. She loved my stories.\n\n\"We showered together, my lover and I, and made our way to the living room to watch television and sink into our lumpy couch,\" I continued, feeling my throat start to clasp and tears forming in my eyes. \"She had acted strangely in the last few weeks, but when you are surrounded by what you perceive as love, you can sometimes be blind to these things.\"\n\n\"She looked at me and said those words that every relationship hinges upon, the words that no one ever wants to hear but when they do, they know exactly what comes next, 'we need to talk,'\" I said, feeling the weight of those words.\n\n\"Being told you are loved and knowing for certain that they mean it is a line that is often blurred. It is like a blanket that pulls itself over your vision like an abstract illusion. A sheet of endless color and imagination of what could be. But sometimes the blanket that you weave together is of your own hands and needle and not theirs. When she said she doesn't love me, that it could never be more than friends, I felt as though the life that pulsed through my veins had stopped. The threads of this life I had stitched together had come apart with one rip. The blanket of comfort, that illusion \u2014 A lie. I did not blame her, although it would probably have made things easier. I blamed myself. Then and every day since, I had assumed the role of the unworthy. The one tossed to the gutter like the rubbish of a fast-food restaurant. My judgment had been clouded, and the control that I believed I had over my world was lost.

He felt no small degree of excitement - he knew this would be the biggest day of his entire career. About three minutes ago, something had crashed in front of the home of the President - and nobody really knew what it was. Even in the chaos of the preparation, the agents shared speculation amongst themselves while they raced in and out of rooms, grabbing weapons and armor. Some believed it was a foreign attack - perhaps an artillery shell that had failed to properly detonate. Others believed the object to be an errant component of a malfunctioning aircraft, separated from its fuselage at an inopportune time. Of course, there were those that subscribed to the more fantastical - whispers of extraterrestrial contact echoed softly throughout the halls, not nearly as loud as the other explanations, but never fully drowned out, either. Burrow wasn't sure what to think. Ultimately, he tried not to speculate too much. He had a history of letting his imagination get ahead of himself, and he knew it. Besides, there was no way to really get any valuable information until he saw the object for himself. To that end, he grabbed his pistol, ensured there was ammunition in the magazine, holstered it, and hurried to join those of his associates that were rushing to the front doors of the facility. The sounds of heavy footsteps and heavier breathing surrounded him as he tried to count the number of agents alongside him, a task easier said than done in the chaos of the situation. Three, five, eight... while Burrow could tell it was more than a dozen, it was impossible to get an exact number. It was, however, possible for Burrow to grasp the scope of the operation, and he noted that the response size did not bode well for what he was about to deal with. The higher-ups were scared; that much was obvious. Burrow couldn't help it when his mind wandered back to the rumors and speculation - specifically, the ones that most would find difficult to believe. The concept of an extraterrestrial - an alien \\- arriving on Earth was difficult for Burrow to grasp, but what else would warrant such a strong response? It wouldn't make any sense otherw- No, Burrow chastised himself. It may not make sense to me, but that doesn't mean anything. Just do your job and don't let the others know that you're crazy. With a deep breath, Burrow reached the doors leading outside, where the agents were massing into one large team. He joined it, and together they all burst forth onto the street. It was quite the sight - to his left, Burrow noted policemen in riot gear keeping a quickly growing crowd at bay. Directly ahead, he could spot a heavy police presence in the middle of the street - cruisers with their emergency lights on, parked in a circle and forming a sort of barricade around the source of a massive plume of smoke trailing off into the sky. Officers darted back and forth between the vehicles, some in the front with their firearms drawn, others in the back barking orders. The agent at the head of Burrow's group stopped and turned around, giving a sharp hand signal directed towards the police cars ahead of them. The silence of the agents as they moved, with the exception of their footfalls, served as somewhat of an unnerving contrast to the shouts and clamor emerging from the police and the crowd. As they approached the police vehicles, Burrow's crowd stopped. The head agent said some short words to one of the officers in the back of the blockade, who turned and shouted \"Make way! Let the Service through!\" before four officers jogged off to the side. The leader of Burrow's group raised her weapon and sharply moved her head towards the smoke plume before cautiously yet quickly moving forward. The other agents behind her did the same, including Burrow, who unholstered his pistol, flipped off the safety, and silently followed behind the other agents. When they got through the barricade, they spread out, giving Burrow his first look at the source of the smoke. What he saw almost made his heart stop. The craft was alien; there was no doubt about that. The design was unlike anything that Burrow had ever seen. It was a rather large dark green disk, of sorts - the top featured a cracked dome of glass in the center, which could not be seen into as a result of the inner compartment being saturated with smoke. The dome was attached at the base to what Burrow could only describe as a disk-shaped fuselage; the top surface curved downward towards the bottom of the craft as it extended outward away from the glass dome at the midpoint of the disk's diameter. The fuselage formed a right angle with the ground at its edge, forming a small flat portion that proceeded downwards. The part of the craft furthest away from Burrow billowed smoke up into the sky. Nobody could get a good look at the bottom of the craft; when it landed, it had partially buried itself in the concrete, preventing any detailed examination of the rest of the object. That didn't matter, though - Burrow could tell without a shadow of a doubt that this thing was foreign. Alien. The agents spread out into a line, pointing their weapons at the alien craft. The only sounds that Burrow could hear were the police officers scrambling behind him and his own, rapid heartbeat. The tension was palpable. Nobody dared approach. Suddenly, steam shot out from under the glass dome, letting out a loud hissing sound. Burrow's heart skipped a beat. The dome slowly opened in a way that reminded Burrow of the launcher closer door of a missile silo. Smoke poured out from inside, although Burrow still couldn't see through it. He noticed his pistol quivering, as were the hands that held it. The dome stopped when it reached a right angle with the road. As more smoke poured out of the dome's compartment, more of the interior became visible. Burrow could now make out a control panel - or series of control panels - lining the inside. He made note of levers, buttons, keyholes, and other apparatuses that he couldn't quite place. Eventually, the smoke thinned enough to see... Burrow nearly dropped his firearm, and he heard a gasp from the agent next to him. There, in the middle of the smoke, was the unmistakable silhouette of a standing humanoid creature. It took a step forward. Burrow's mind raced. What would this creature look like? Sound like? What was its culture? How would they communicate? Did this thing even talk in a way that he would be able to recognize? What would this mean for the planet at large? The alien took another step, and Burrow forcefully put the breaks on his runaway train of thought. He took a deep breath and stabilized the weapon in his hands. There would be time to ask those questions, but now wasn't it. Humankind was about to make first contact with real, true alien life - and he was going to be on the front lines. The silhouette moved again, and some of the smoke cleared. It moved again, and Burrow caught what seemed to be an arm briefly emerge from the smoke before retreating back into it. He took another deep breath, and double checked to make sure the safety was off on his pistol. Time almost seemed to stop as he saw the alien take the final step out of the smoke... ...and his jaw dropped when a roughly 60 year-old Caucasian male casually strolled onto and across the hull of the craft, and then down onto the street.", "rewritten_text": "Agent Burrow's heart raced as he and his Secret Service colleagues hurried to gather their equipment.

The law had international repercussions when it was first passed at the end of 2015. The \u2018Eye for an Eye Inversion\u2019 law, as it was called. Essentially, for every life saved, the saver is granted the right to take one life away. An interesting law, made, once again, by politicians who didn\u2019t really understand what they were unleashing upon the world. The idea was simple, legalize certain homicides, which would increase vigilante activity, which in turn would decrease crime. The crazy thing was, it worked. Many doctors became part-time assassins, killing almost as much as they saved. After a few years, the death rates actually decreased, as those killing illegally had mostly died off and those killing legally were breaking even with lives saved. That is, until the disease. They called it the Red Death; in part, as a homage to the Black Death; and in part, as a reference to the boils of blood that represented one of its many symptoms. Millions died. Just when all hope was lost, a vaccine was invented. Projections showed that without it, hundreds of millions would have died. I\u2019m not a doctor, but that doesn\u2019t matter.

How it had gotten that far into the solar system without being seen remained a mystery, one that NASA had told us not to worry about; there were more important things for the crew aboard the International Space Station to do while governments on Earth plotted ways to prevent the looming disaster. We worked through the station's night, hoping to come up with something we could throw at it. The Russians decided without any discussion that they would launch their module at the icy body, in hopes that a hurried impact would knock the comet off its course, which seemed to be headed toward eastern Europe, possibly putting a bulls-eye on western Russia.

To put it succinctly, we expect all life on Earth to be destroyed in a matter of an hour. There's nothing we can do from here, except wait. And hope. Hope that maybe everyone with their fingers on the buttons will coordinate and target the same place. Otherwise, not only will that comet wipe out Earth, but we'll be in range to get hit by either pieces of the comet or the nukes themselves. I recommend everyone prepare for the worst, and pray to whatever god you believe in.\" We were stunned; nobody seemed able to speak for a long moment.

I wanted to speak, say something, anything, but my vocal cords seemed frozen. \"If anyone needs me, I'll be in the operations room,\" Stern said into the quiet that surrounded him. He grabbed a handle bar and pushed himself forward into the corridor that led up front. After a moment, there were a few gasps, a couple of tears floating in the air as crewmembers cried silently.

This is what the recruiting posters don't tell you about. Not that I'm complaining. It can't be worse than joining the herds of humanity waiting to be stuffed into that transport or one of its sisters, hauled off to what the aliens refer to as \"domestic companion facilities\". Our attack will take advantage of two factors, the same two that allowed us to fight them to a standstill in the first place: first, that the desert, the only Earth environment where they can survive without life support gear, is even more hostile to them than it is to us. The heat makes them extremely sluggish, and they have to rely primarily on automated defenses that can be outsmarted with a little good old human craftiness. The second is that they don't like to kill us. Seems strange, I know, considering they exterminated about 80% of the population, but that was a last-ditch, brute-force maneuver to keep their only remaining beachhead from being overrun. As far as we can tell, the aliens regard us as something akin to - and I say this in all seriousness - puppies. Intelligent puppies who refuse to behave, but also cute and cuddly. A lot of them grew hardened to us during the war years, but now they've gotten soft again; their guard is down. They want us to be their friends; we're pretty sure they see the tithe as an opportunity for humans to see how much fun our lives could be if we just accept our place in the universe, put on their equivalent of a collar, and play fetch with their kids. Some people would rather do just that. But not me. After 35 years of stalemate and watching my friends and family be shipped off to gilded alien cages, the years of organization, training, hiding, building, and waiting have finally come to an end. I refuse to be some ET's plaything. I survey the determined faces around me, take one last look through the binoculars, and give the order to move out. We're taking back our planet.

This is the reality that the recruiting posters fail to convey. Not that I am complaining. It cannot be more challenging than joining the masses of humanity waiting to be loaded onto that transport or one of its counterparts, destined for what the aliens term \"domestic companion facilities.\"\n\nOur strategy will capitalize on two key factors, the same ones that enabled us to hold our ground against them initially. Firstly, the desert, the sole Earth environment where they can exist without life support gear, is even more inhospitable to them than it is to us. The intense heat renders them lethargic, forcing them to rely predominantly on automated defenses that can be outwitted with human ingenuity. Secondly, they do not have a penchant for killing us. It may seem perplexing, given that they decimated approximately 80% of the population, but that was a desperate, brute-force tactic to prevent their sole remaining foothold from being overrun. As far as we can discern, the aliens view us as something akin to - and I say this earnestly - puppies. Intelligent puppies who defy obedience, yet also endearing and cuddly. While many of them hardened their hearts towards us during the war years, they have since grown complacent; their vigilance has waned. They desire our companionship; we suspect they perceive the tithe as an opportunity for humans to embrace the pleasures of life by accepting our role in the universe, donning their equivalent of a collar, and engaging in playful activities with their offspring. Some individuals may be inclined to comply. However, not I. After enduring 35 years of deadlock and witnessing my loved ones being consigned to opulent alien enclosures, the years of preparation, training, concealment, construction, and anticipation have culminated.

The price tag hanging off of this job, however, quickly made me change my tune. \u201cMy employer will pay you 20 million US dollars to make a program for her.\u201d The mysterious messenger said. Seemed simple enough, but I needed more information than that. \"I need specifics. I can\u2019t take a job based on the number of zeros. If I did that, I\u2019d be arrested within a week.\u201d I replied, trying to sound disinterested. \u201cYou\u2019ll receive the details once you accept the job. Take it or leave it.\u201d He retorted. This clearly wasn\u2019t optional. Nobody offers 20 million to a hacker with any intention of letting them live if they refuse. \u201cI figured you\u2019d go for that one guy down in Chicago that broke the firewalls on that fancy new OS shit\u2019s hooked up to.\u201d I said, trying to see why they picked me instead of anybody else. His response came quickly and without any obvious signs of bullshit. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short. We know that you are the most qualified to do this job. That guy in Chicago would become more of a liability in the end. But you have no loyalty. You simply follow the money. We need that.\u201d So this was a black hat job. I hadn\u2019t done one of these since I nearly got caught three years ago. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll do it. When do I learn what I\u2019m making?\u201d Time to visit the wardrobe, I guess. \u201cWe\u2019ll contact you. From now until completion, you talk to no one. You don\u2019t leave the house. If you need something, order it online. You\u2019ll have 20 million to throw around once you\u2019re done.\u201d He responded, terminating the connection. This was going to be interesting. The specifics came in about three days later. I was to make a program that used a fast mutating algorithm to predict when certain events would occur. The event type would be told to me once the first part was done. Seemed simple enough. I had done stuff like this before for wall street types looking for an edge. Was always fun to see them get arrested on live TV because I ratted them out. Rivals pay very well for that type of information. The first part went off very simply, and I got it done within a day. I sent word to the messenger that I was ready for the second part of the job, hoping it would be that easy. \u201cThe types of events we want you to predict are political shifts. Not small ones like your local representative changing his view on a bean farmer\u2019s tax. We want major leadership changes.\u201d The messenger replied, dashing all hopes I had of an easy paycheck. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about predicting when a coup could be possible.\u201d I took a wild stab in the dark, hoping to get some more information to refine the program. There was a split second of delay in his response. \u201cIn a way, yes. Can you do that?\u201d The question was very clearly rhetorical. If I don\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t live to see the next day. \u201cYes, I can. When do you need it done by?\u201d I replied, content with knowing the specifics. \u201cThere is no hard time limit. We would prefer it to be done by March.\u201d So I had half a year, but his response made it clear that every day past March meant a large dock in pay. I waited a second before replying. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll get started.\u201d The coding of the second half of this program was not easy. It took me weeks to get the basics finished. The advanced parts took even longer. The fine tuning made me come extremely close to the deadline, and I was starting to worry if I would make it in time. But on February the 27th, I finally finished it. All the bugs ironed out, the glitches removed. It was the finest piece of coding I had ever made. I contacted the messenger, and he connected me to the woman that hired me. We didn\u2019t share names. She began the conversation. \u201cI am pleased to see that you came through on this. The money will be wired to your offshore accounts within the week. Any questions now that we have completed business?\u201d She had a very authoritative tone that made me be wary to ask anything. \u201cWell, assassins say that at the right time and place, a knife can topple an empire. My computer program can accurately tell you those times and places. So I have just one. What do you plan on using this for?\u201d I responded. \u201cYou should know that by now. You just told me what we\u2019re going to use it for.\u201d She responded, almost laughing at me because I had to ask. \u201cFair enough. I see why the price tag was so high. Pleasure doing business.\u201d I responded, ending the connection. Time will tell if I regret this decision, but so far, the only events I\u2019ve tracked have been in Africa. Either they\u2019re a PMC trying to keep the war economy going, or they\u2019re testing the program for a really big global paradigm shift. (Constructive criticism welcome and wanted.

Still not very good at this.", "rewritten_text": "I logged into the messenger, initially assuming it was just an angry former employee seeking revenge by hiring me to create a program to sabotage their boss. However, the high price attached to the job quickly caught my attention. \"My employer is willing to pay you 20 million US dollars to develop a program for her,\" the mysterious messenger stated. The task seemed straightforward, but I needed more details before committing. \"I require specifics. I cannot accept a job solely based on the monetary value. If I did, I would likely be apprehended within a week,\" I responded, attempting to sound nonchalant. \"You will receive the necessary information once you agree to the job. Take it or leave it,\" he retorted. It was evident that this was not a choice. No one offers 20 million to a hacker without expecting compliance under threat. \"I assumed you would approach the individual in Chicago who breached the firewalls of that new operating system,\" I remarked, trying to understand why they selected me over others. His response was prompt and devoid of deception. \"Do not underestimate yourself. We believe you are the most qualified for this task. The individual in Chicago would pose more risks in the long run. However, you lack loyalty. You are motivated by money. That is what we require,\" he explained. It became apparent that this was a black hat job, a type of work I had not engaged in since narrowly escaping capture three years ago. \"Very well. I accept. When will I receive further details?\" It seemed a visit to the wardrobe was in order. \"We will be in touch. Until the project is completed, you are to maintain absolute secrecy. Do not leave your residence. If you require anything, order it online. Upon completion, you will have 20 million at your disposal,\" he concluded, severing the connection. This endeavor promised to be intriguing. The specifics were provided three days later. I was tasked with creating a program utilizing a rapidly evolving algorithm to predict significant events. The nature of these events would be disclosed upon completion of the initial phase. It appeared to be a straightforward assignment, reminiscent of previous work for Wall Street clients seeking an advantage. It was always satisfying to witness their downfall on live television after exposing their illicit activities. Competitors paid handsomely for such information. The first phase progressed smoothly, completed within a day. I informed the messenger that I was prepared for the subsequent stage, hoping it would be equally manageable. \"We require you to predict political shifts, not minor changes like a local representative altering their stance on a tax issue for bean farmers. We are interested in major leadership transitions,\" the messenger clarified, dispelling any hopes of an effortless payday. \"You are essentially asking me to forecast potential coups,\" I ventured, seeking additional information to refine the program. There was a brief pause before his response. \"In a sense, yes. Can you accomplish this?\" The question was clearly rhetorical. Failure was not an option. \"Yes, I am capable. When is the deadline?\" I replied, satisfied with the specifics provided. \"There is no strict timeframe. However, we prefer it to be completed by March,\" he stated. I had approximately six months, but it was evident that delays would result in reduced compensation. After a moment's pause, I replied, \"Understood. I will commence work.\" The coding for the second phase proved challenging. It took weeks to establish the foundation and even longer to implement the advanced components. The meticulous fine-tuning brought me perilously close to the deadline, causing concern about timely completion. However, on February 27th, I finally completed the program. All bugs were resolved, and glitches eliminated. It stood as the most refined piece of coding I had ever produced. I contacted the messenger, who connected me with the woman who had hired me. We exchanged no names. She initiated the conversation. \"I am pleased with your performance. The funds will be transferred to your offshore accounts within the week. Any inquiries now that our business is concluded?\" Her authoritative demeanor made me hesitant to pose any questions. \"Assassins claim that a knife, at the right time and place, can bring down an empire. My program can accurately pinpoint those moments. I have one question: What do you intend to utilize this for?\" I inquired. \"You should already know. You just provided the answer,\" she replied, almost mocking my query. \"Fair enough. I understand why the compensation was substantial. It was a pleasure doing business,\" I responded, terminating the connection. Only time will reveal if I will regret this decision, but thus far, the events I have monitored have been centered in Africa. They may be linked to a private military company seeking to perpetuate the war economy, or they could be testing the program for a significant global shift.

My name is Garcia, it means \"Mighty with a spear\" and I suppose that's what this is all about. My spear is an 80 meter pole I found washed up on the edges of my island, Puerto Rico. I suppose I'm writing this with too much pride though, so let me start from the beginning. After the damage to the island in 2017 and the failed attempts to get a functional power grid back online and the general lack of food, shelter, or even drinking water there was much to be done on the island. By mid-2018 the Trump presidency - as well as the majority of aid organizations- had forgotten about us. 'peqgroupos' or little groups began to form. They're like little communities of families that all work together to provide the necessities, where each member has a job. My job was to man the HAM radio and communicate with the fishing boats and any aid volunteers that did come. Fortunately for my peqgroupo one of the other families was Cuba and had experience making everything from nothing, and had spent years learning how to work with electronics and vacuum tubes from his bisabuelo. He was able to bring me from 10 watts to 100 watts, and made the signal quality both for transmission and reception much better. If I set things up right I could do moon-bounce pretty well even, not that we had a use for it. About halfway though 2020 is when I found the large pole on the beach, and with help from all of the peqgroupo, got it set up and attached to a larger transmitter salvaged from a pirate radio station from the Virgins, and with that and the now semi-functional power grid I was at 10,000 watts. When the power grid could handle it I was the voice of the island. Sure, the sound quality was marginal at best, even though the best of AM radios, but the island had music again. I felt like a God. I put on any music I could find, and at least once an hour broadcast a message asking for aid. By new years this year (2021) the island had practically claimed independence, and the attitude had swayed to not wanting help. To knowing that we could do better on our own. Sure, we still had a worthless head in the house, but excluding that we had our nation back. We were Puerto Rico. February, 3 months ago, was the first time I heard it. It sounded vaguely like English, but like none that I had ever heard. I was tuned to 111.11 scanning though when I picked it up. I decided to transmit back. \"Hello? Hola?\" the transmission continued for about 10 minutes until suddenly it erupted, what must've been 50 distinct voices came in, all in this foreign language, and then there was a massive static burst followed by one voice which said something yet again in an unknown language, but with an inquisitive tone. With out an idea what I was getting into I responded \"Who is this? Quien es este? Quien? Quien?\". A silent 10 minutes passed, before I heard one word repeated multiple times \"Atlantis. Atlantis. Atlantis.\" I tried talking to the station again but it was silent. The next day I tuned to the same station again, but this time the same message was playing on repeat. \"This is Atlantis. This is Atlantis. We not did thought any survivors. On way. 10 days. 10 days.\" I responded quickly. \"Hello Atlantis. What is your location?\" The same message repeated multiple times before going silent for about half an hour. I waited in fear that the survivors message implied they were in need. Finally I heard \"Vega. 10 days. 25 year light.\" repeat twice, and then once more as \"Vega. 10 dia. 25 a\u00f1o luz\" and then stop, as if waiting for a reply. I thought for a moment. The English was broken, and the distance, 25 light years, surly someone must be messing with me. I decided to tune away from the frequency and continue my music broadcasts. Ten days later it came. Atlantis, the lost city, was not lost to the sea, but rather to the stars. it landed in the water about an 1/4 mile from the island. At least we assume it landed, since it was simply there in the morning. As we gathered on the beach we saw the side of the craft - a large bubble, so large it absorbed the horizon- open up and on the inside was an entire city, and on this edge a large crowd of people stood there cheering, as if they had just won the super bowl. Even from this distance the sound was overwhelming. The entire craft came this way. The passengers were human. I am Garcia, the man who brought Atlantis home with my spear, and with it the cure to all of our diseases and cancers, the solution to our - and the world's - energy needs, and so, so much more. We have reunited with our Gods to find that we are Gods ourselves. Atlantis was a city of engineers, scientists, and hope. They brought us libraries that would've made Alexandria look like a rural middle school book club's trash pile, and foods that we could have never imagined. So how about that America? We ended up aiding you. We aided the world.

The spear I wield is an 80-meter pole that I discovered washed up on the shores of my island, Puerto Rico. However, I realize that I may have started this with too much pride, so let me begin from the start.\n\nFollowing the devastation to the island in 2017, efforts to restore a functional power grid and provide basic necessities like food, shelter, and clean water were unsuccessful. By mid-2018, both the Trump administration and the majority of aid organizations had seemingly forgotten about us. In response, small groups known as 'peqgroupos' began to form. These groups consisted of families working together to meet their needs, with each member assigned a specific role.\n\nIn my peqgroupo, my responsibility was to operate the HAM radio to communicate with fishing boats and any potential aid volunteers. Fortunately, one of the families in our group had Cuban roots and possessed expertise in creating essentials from scratch. With his knowledge passed down from his bisabuelo, he enhanced my radio setup from 10 watts to 100 watts, significantly improving signal quality for both transmission and reception. With the help of the entire peqgroupo, we discovered a large pole on the beach around mid-2020. By connecting it to a larger transmitter salvaged from a pirate radio station in the Virgin Islands, and with the partially functional power grid, I was able to transmit at 10,000 watts. When the power grid could support it, I became the voice of the island, broadcasting music and messages requesting aid.\n\nBy the start of the new year in 2021, the island had almost declared independence, with a newfound determination to thrive independently. Despite facing challenges, including a less-than-ideal leader, we had reclaimed our nation - Puerto Rico.\n\nIn February, three months ago, I encountered something extraordinary. While scanning frequencies on 111.11, I intercepted a transmission that sounded vaguely like English but unlike any dialect I had heard before. I responded, initiating a ten-minute exchange that suddenly escalated into a cacophony of 50 distinct voices speaking in an unfamiliar language. Following a burst of static, a single voice uttered something in an unknown tongue, sounding inquisitive. In response, I asked, \"Who is this? Quien es este? Quien? Quien?\" After a silent pause, the voice repeated \"Atlantis\" multiple times.\n\nThe next day, I tuned in to the same frequency and heard a repeated message: \"This is Atlantis. We did not expect any survivors. On the way. 10 days.\" I promptly replied, seeking their location. The response indicated \"Vega. 10 days. 25 light years,\" suggesting a distant origin. Despite my initial skepticism, I continued my broadcasts, awaiting further communication.\n\nTen days later, Atlantis, the legendary lost city, appeared not submerged in the sea but among the stars, landing a quarter mile from our island. The craft's massive bubble-like structure opened to reveal an entire city, with jubilant passengers cheering as if celebrating a victory. The craft approached our shore, revealing human passengers who brought with them cures for diseases, solutions for energy needs, and invaluable knowledge.\n\nI am Garcia, the one who guided Atlantis home with my spear, ushering in a new era of enlightenment and progress for our island and the world. Atlantis, a city of innovators and dreamers, bestowed upon us libraries surpassing Alexandria's grandeur and culinary delights beyond imagination. In a twist of fate, Puerto Rico became the sanctuary of Atlantis, a city rediscovered to benefit not only us but the entirety of humanity.\n\nSo, America, how about that?

She looked up from her book briefly and met my gaze.

It was the first time I had seen something in a thought rather than hear it. I had to know her. I pushed my hands beneath my glasses and rubbed my eyes. Lately I\u2019d been hearing a buzzing in my ears whenever I was alone. That was often. I became aware of it most when I was in the spaces she used to occupy. That, too, was often. My night terrors looked less like the unknown and more like what I used to know. That was worse. She was amused when I showed up at her flat for the first time with a bouquet of her favourite flowers. I couldn\u2019t help but grin when an image of a meadow flooded my mind. She must\u2019ve been no older than seven, laughing and picking black-eyed susans one by one. I loved seeing the world through her eyes. It was a wonderful one. That was the thing with her. With others, I could catch words, snippets of conversations held in the head. Shopping lists, day planning, the like. But she was a symphony of colours and sensations. Occasionally, she\u2019d have a word thought too, but even those were poetic in nature. She was a breath of fresh air in a forest and I felt like I had lived in a city my whole life. Almost always, she smelt like butterscotch. She told me it reminded her of home. In time, that was home to me, too. I asked the bartender for another drink, avoiding his eyes. Aside from telepathy I\u2019ve always had a good sense when someone was disapproving of me. Maybe it was from all the teachers who thought I was nothing but a cheater.

Well, I've had it. This damn \"gift\" needs to be good for something. Sure I can order people to give me free stuff or even raise my own wage, but that often doesn't end well, and I already gave myself the promotions I wanted. No, I want to feel good about my gift. That's what I really need. And so, today, I am heading for the HQ of Barney's. I am going to reinstate their bonuses, and I am going to raise all their wages by 4$ per hour, and I am going to have them put those good news out on every social media platform they use!

Today, I encountered a challenging situation while trying to purchase pants at Barney's. The store's employees were displeased with the bonus cuts that I, mistakenly perceived as their manager, had implemented. After clarifying my position, I found myself exhausted from the ordeal. I did not want to engage in arguments with the sales staff who were negatively impacted by the company's profit-driven decisions.\n\nI have reached a breaking point. This so-called \"gift\" must serve a greater purpose. While I could easily demand free items or increase my own salary, the consequences are often unfavorable, and I have already granted myself the desired promotions. What I truly desire is to use my gift for good. Therefore, today, I am heading to Barney's headquarters. I intend to reinstate the employees' bonuses, raise their wages by $4 per hour, and ensure that this positive news is shared across all their social media platforms. The potential public relations backlash if they attempt to retract the raises should give them pause for thought.

The upcoming segment is nearly insurmountable - the gaps are too vast for mere mortals. I tested it myself. The spikes below are poised to end their journey. They leap, landing on the initial platform... trapped, or so it seems. But wait... what's this? Their inadvertent action causes a chain reaction, enabling them to leap from platform to platform. Who are these individuals, indeed?\n\nDespite their progress, the final challenge at the pit appears unbeatable. It is filled with a lethal poison that would surely claim their lives before they reach the end. How could they possibly hold their breath for that duration? They leap into the pit, evading the spikes and boulders, enduring the physical strain. Minutes pass, and it seems they are on the brink of exhaustion. Yet, they persist, displaying remarkable resilience. Their ability to navigate the final meters with air still in their lungs is nothing short of astonishing and terrifying.\n\nThe ultimate trial awaits them on the bridge, guarded by the fiercest warrior in the world. The bridge is on the verge of collapse at any moment. They make a daring move, severing the bridge, causing the guardian to fall. Defeated, I watch as they defy the odds. The man swings to the other side, leaving me in disbelief. It has been an honor, ladies and gentlemen. Before I bid farewell, may I inquire about your names?

I wasn't, of course. Who could be? But I had to be positive. I had to press down every shred of fear and doubt for both their sake. \"Maybe he'll have some great adventure story. Or a romance. Maybe there's a girl out there with the same spiral birthmark on her shoulder?\" \"Stop. Just stop. This isn't like the stories, Trav. There's no romance option here. Only tragedies.\" There was a knock at the door. A rail thin man in an oversized suit and comb over peeked through the window to the room. I nodded for him to enter. \"Evening,\" he said. \"My name is Frank Otten, from the Office of Destiny Affairs. I'm here to talk options for your son there.\" He noisily scraped a chair from the opposite side of the room and sat next to me, with a smile on his face that can only be described as bureaucratic. \"My my, look at that hair. He's a protagonist, no doubt about it. We see two or three a year here lately. Used to be that you'd go decades between them, but since that second moon showed up, well, we've been busy.\" \"We've had a long day,\" Ruth began to protest. \"I know,\" Frank interrupted, raising both hands apologetically. \"I know. And you have a lot to think about. But these things don't wait until you're ready. They just happen, and so we need to go through the paperwork immediately. I'm sorry.\" He pulled a binder out of his satchel and licked his index finger before opening it and flipping through the pages. \"It says here that he's marked with a spiral on his shoulder. Is that right or left?\" \"Left,\" I answered. \"I see. Do either of you have any royal lineage? No? What about ancient curses? Father or grandfather ever open up a tomb or desecrate a--\" \"No,\" Ruth interrupted, loudly. \"Ok. Ok. That leaves us with options, at least. Royal lineage, that's a bad hand. You basically die immediately. Curses, well, those never end well for anybody. But you two are lucky.\" \"We don't feel lucky.\" He sighed. \"No, sir, no I don't imagine you do. Now, this isn't a science. In fact it's quite the opposite, isn't it? But based on previous protagonists we can map some likely paths for you and your son. The first option is to leave him at the foot of a mountain upon which there must be a monastery. I have a list here if you're interested. Closest one is in Old Detroit. That mountain popped up after the Second Cataclysm. The forest around it is infested with lizard rats but the monastery itself is quite nice.\" \"No,\" Ruth said quickly. She pulled our boy in closer, putting her nose to his forehead. \"What's a lizard rat?\" I asked, trying to deflect the conversation, to delay the inevitable for just a moment longer. \"Well it's just like a rat except it has scales and the legs of a deer and saber teeth.\" I tried my best to be incredulous, to pretend to be anything other than numb. \"Have you ever seen a rat?\" \"Stop it!\" Ruth screamed. \"Just stop it, Trav. I know what you're doing. You always do this. Just stop.\" The silence that filled the room felt like the air before a storm. I could feel a small part of me fail, the part that held back all the dread and the fear and the helpless anger. It all came rushing in like floodwater. I shot up from my chair, flipping it over in the process, and stood by the window so Ruth couldn't see my tears. \"The second option is for you to be taken. The overlord who currently runs the western provinces of Canada has an enslavement program for the parents of protagonists. There's a small form to fill out, after which you'll be abducted and transported to one of his mining camps. This is a good option, as the story may revolve around your son attempting to rescue you.\" \"Where does his story lead from the monastery?\" I asked. \"Nowhere,\" Ruth answered. \"None of these stories go anywhere. We're not giving him up.\" \"Ma'am,\" Frank said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"If you do not forfeit your child to his destiny, you will die. There's never been a protagonist whose parents survive. As soon as he can barely take care of himself, you will meet a violent end, and it is likely that he will witness this.\" She tried to talk, but all that came out was a guttural sob. Her whole body convulsed with each cry, each whimper that escaped her mouth. Our son, our only boy, destined to lose us, to make his way alone in a horrible world and then meet his own end in some distant, bloody place. That's how every protagonist went, violent, scared, and alone, and afterwards the world just gets a little worse. Every one of them sacrificed just pushes us further into hell. \"I won't do it,\" I said finally. Somewhere in me, something woke, something deep but bright. Suddenly there was a fire in me. \"I don't care about destiny. I don't care about dark lords or overlords or whatever the hell else is in your binder. I'm not giving my son to this hell!\" Frank rose from his seat suddenly, flipped a few pages and ran his finger down in search of something. \"I see,\" he muttered. \"Very well.

I wasn't okay with it, of course. Who could be? But I had to stay positive, suppressing every ounce of fear and doubt for their sake.\n\n\"Maybe he'll have an exciting adventure or a romance.

You two are lucky,\" Frank said. \"Based on previous protagonists, we can map out likely paths for your son.\"\n\nHe presented two options: leaving the baby at a monastery near Old Detroit or being taken by an overlord in Canada. Ruth rejected both options, refusing to give up their child.\n\n\"If you do not forfeit your child to his destiny, you will die. There's never been a protagonist whose parents survive,\" Frank warned.\n\nRuth broke down in tears, realizing the grim fate that awaited them. I stood up, defiant, refusing to accept the predetermined path for our son.\n\n\"I won't do it,\" I declared. \"I'm not giving my son to this fate!\"\n\nFrank acknowledged our decision and left, wishing us luck in our defiance against the dark forces that sought to control our son's destiny."}, "t1_i4qj605": {"original_text": "\"Aha!\" The crazed madman screamed.

For instance, I had never noticed how good poetry leads you to a place with a view and, instead of describing the place; it takes six steps forward and describes what lies beyond the horizon. I had noticed Jeanine's natural inclination for lies and deception, and I found it charming. I never noticed how she layered her lies so naturally that I had never really seen her at her most passionate. After six years of marriage, I had never seen my wife in the height of emotion. That night a man followed her, she said. He threatened to rape her, she said. He beat her half to death and she miraculously landed a slash on his jugular with a knife, she said. She almost didn't live to say it, though. She was pretty much doomed and unconscious. I had never noticed the devil. It can be summoned and loves despair. I didn't notice, back then, the gleam in its eyes after I pleaded for my wife, nor the smile fluttering above its face as it offered me a part time job to pay for the debt I was about to incur into. I had never noticed the amount of reverse engineering which solving a murder requires, and consequently, the amount of design required to orchestrate death. I can't just point at a person and mutter a cause of death; my job is being the cause of death. I must fill in the details. I must foresee how many lives are going to be touched by any given death. I have to work against some deaths that are already in course. After all, if no one could tinker with death, I wouldn't have been able to save my wife. Nature designs deaths, too. People design deaths some times. I can let them happen or fight them. I had never noticed the secrets my wife kept just so she could use them to hide atrocities. She splurged on shoes so she could divert some money to pay for storage. She carried a huge bag of make up to conceal chemicals and blades among the powders and sticks of glittering beauty. She claimed to hate to drive automatic, which I do, so she could have a car of her own that I would never use. She created an online book club just so she could have some hours per week to go wherever she needed to, and it was never to the library. I never noticed, during the investigation, that the man who attacked my wife had rope burns and old bruises. I knew he had been missing for a while, but that only made me think he lost his mind and wandered off and attacked the first creature he could overpower. I had never noticed how powerful she is. I can tell now, through the deaths she sets in motion, the amount of suffering she likes to pile up to begin her elegant process. I had never seen her eyes burning in the throes of passion, but my job following the strings of death has led me to her hiding places. I've seen her face looking its best while she does what she's best at. Researching, planning, testing, doing the deed, covering up. Killing is her only real fulfillment.

Her ability to weave lies so effortlessly had masked her true passion from my sight all these years of marriage. It wasn't until a harrowing incident unfolded that I truly saw her emotions laid bare.\n\nThat fateful night, she recounted a terrifying encounter with a man who had followed and attacked her. She bravely fought back, inflicting a fatal wound on her assailant, narrowly escaping death herself. It was then that I realized the presence of evil, lurking in the shadows, drawn to despair. I failed to notice the sinister gleam in its eyes as it offered me a Faustian bargain to settle a debt incurred that night.\n\nThe intricacies of solving a murder revealed to me the intricate design required to orchestrate death. It wasn't just about identifying a cause of death; it was about becoming the instrument of death itself. I had to meticulously plan each detail, considering the ripple effect it would have on those touched by the loss. Sometimes, I found myself battling against deaths already set in motion, striving to alter fate.\n\nNature and people alike design deaths, but I had never truly grasped the extent of my wife's involvement in such dark machinations. Her seemingly innocent actions concealed a web of secrets and atrocities. From extravagant purchases to covertly hiding dangerous items among her belongings, she had crafted a facade to mask her true intentions.\n\nDuring the investigation, I overlooked crucial details about the attacker, dismissing his past as a mere descent into madness. Little did I realize the depth of my wife's power and the calculated cruelty she wielded behind closed doors. Through my grim work, I uncovered her hidden talents for research, planning, and execution of deadly schemes. Killing was her ultimate satisfaction, a realization that both terrified and captivated me.\n\nIn witnessing her eyes ablaze with passion for her macabre craft, I came to understand the true purpose behind my assigned role. I had never before encountered someone so adept at embracing the darkness within, and it dawned on me why fate had led me down this chilling path."}, "t1_cn7r0pl": {"original_text": "\"Please Enter.\" Came the a metallic voice from beyond the door.

Wires upon wires flowed outward from a coalition of tubes and machinery that encircled an enormous processor. One the likes of which he had never seen or even could imagine.

Steam rolled from these tubes and covered the floor in a strange cold fog. \"Hello, Tom.\" As the CPU's lights flickered to the sound of the voice he finally realized that it had belonged to it. A realization that surprised him. \"Y-you know my name?\" He stuttered. \"Of course, Tom. I know all of my employed names.

He thought he would be working on new ads or some app. For crying out loud, his boss was an advanced super-computer! How could he get out of it now, though? He was already a captive in this room.

I know that must be shocking, and really all of this must be--but let me ask you, isn't this what you have always dreamt of doing?\" The machine was right. Tom couldn't deny the honesty in the truth, but to have it all happen so suddenly. It was jarring to say the least. But he had always dreamt somewhere deep down of working on a project like this, hadn't he? Tendrils of the fog were floating upwards, sifting in through Toms nostrils. Blown by floor based fans projected towards his face, the intoxicating effect of the smoky pheromones had left Tom exceedingly pliable. Before the massive mega-computer the floor suddenly opened up revealing five human sized pods. Tom eyed them nervously, one was obviously empty. This was what he wanted to do though. Right?

I lie in my bed, head resting on the pane, fading my concious through the crystal sky on a bed of stars. Since I can remember, the moon has kept me captivated for hours on end. As if the fluorescent glow was baking my soul dry with each sleepless night i stare. Most would think this be a case of mild to severe insomnia. However i do not stay awake because of an inability to do so. I cannot sleep out of pure fixation. For you see, as long as i can remember there has been this spot. Its as if only I can see it. It follows the rotation of the moon but i can follow it through the surface. It speaks in static. I could read the rthymes echoing through my mind as if a broken tv was trying to aggressively push its drum and bass album. The cacophony lobotomized me to the point of vegetation every night. I lay paralyzed as the point would grow both in size and in volume. I've completely lost track of my days. I vaguely remember trying to keep a journal to remind myself but I would never be able to read it once I've gotten to this point. Well i guess during the day, sleep deprived me at least tried. For now i just stare at the spot feeling as though time has lost all meaning. As the point keeps growing it has become apparent that it is coming from inside the moon. The surface cracks as a black ooze steadily erupts forming what appears to be....a hand. Long black fingers connected to a massive palm flexed and contorted in ways that no earthly hand would be capable of. An eye opened in the center of the palm containing two golden irises at opposite ends. The fingers stretched out across the heavens as the pupils spun with such speed that it looked as if the eye was staring right back at me. The hand made its way closer casting a shadow over the once magnificent night sky. The closer the hand got, the more i could make out the rest of this strange creature pushing its way through the moon towards me. It was as if you were to pull a person out of a small can they were forcibly shoved in. The body was covered in eyes that the pupils dancing between sockets as if they were all connected. The only crushed part of its body that didn't seem human was a very condensced horses head that was cracking itself back into place. It was like watching the last seconds of a person falling off a building reversed in slow motion. I couldn't hear the cracks but i could feel every single one as it moved closer and closer. The static was so loud it was almost inaudible. I can't move. I cant even close my eyes. I just look whatever it is in the eye and accept what I knew since I first stopped remembering anything but this wretched spot. I'm fucked... The being touches my chest as if it were memory foam. Then the strangest feeling I could possibly imagine engulfed my entire body. It was as if...as if the worst most painful sensation ive ever felt was stemming from the point of contact but everything surrounding felt amazing.

I lie in bed, my head resting on the pane, allowing my consciousness to drift through the crystal sky adorned with stars. For as long as I can recall, the moon has held me captivated for hours on end. Its fluorescent glow seems to parch my soul with each sleepless night I spend staring at it.\n\nMany might assume this to be a case of mild to severe insomnia. However, my wakefulness is not due to an inability to sleep but rather a deep fixation. There is a spot that only I seem to see, following the moon's rotation but visible to me beneath its surface. It emits a static-like sound, with rhythms echoing through my mind as if a malfunctioning TV were trying to forcefully play a drum and bass album. This cacophony renders me almost vegetative each night, as the spot grows in size and intensity.\n\nI have lost all sense of time, vaguely recalling attempts to keep a journal to remind myself, only to find it unreadable once I reach this point. During the day, my sleep-deprived self at least made an effort. Now, I simply stare at the spot, feeling as though time has become meaningless. It has become clear that the spot originates from within the moon, as its surface cracks and releases a black ooze that forms what appears to be a hand.\n\nThis hand, with long black fingers connected to a massive palm, contorts in unnatural ways. An eye opens in the center of the palm, with two golden irises at opposite ends. The fingers extend across the heavens, the pupils spinning rapidly, almost as if the eye is gazing back at me. As the hand approaches, casting a shadow over the once magnificent night sky, I discern the rest of a strange creature emerging from the moon.\n\nThis being, with a body covered in eyes whose pupils shift between sockets, appears almost human except for a condensed horse's head that seems to be reforming itself. It is akin to watching a person falling off a building in reverse slow motion. The cracks and movements are palpable as it draws nearer, the deafening static almost imperceptible. I am paralyzed, unable to even close my eyes, as I meet the creature's gaze and resign myself to the inevitable.\n\nThe being's touch on my chest feels like memory foam, followed by an indescribable sensation that engulfs my entire being. It is a mix of excruciating pain at the point of contact and overwhelming pleasure elsewhere. My body convulses as the ecstasy fades into agony, the creature's hand pushing through me, enlarging the hole as it forces its body into mine. My body turns black, with only remnants remaining, soon to be consumed by..."}, "t1_d61q4r2": {"original_text": "The leather straps binding my wrists and legs to the wooden chair only gave a stained squeak when I tired fighting my way out. Though I was overall fixed in position, my mid-section could still twist side to side upon the chair. I had tried lunging forward when I was first strapped in, but the brace around the front of my neck bruised my hyoid and put a quick end to that venture. With my back tight against the chair and only my eyes being free to move, I began to look around the room. There wasn\u2019t much in terms of d\u00e9cor, as I faced a blank white wall without a door. Above my head was a metal contraption with a chin strap, similar to that of some archaic electric chair. If I really strained my sight to the left, I could see a similar chair to mine with several pipes and cords running between the matching set. It was only a matter of time until they lowered it on top of me and began their experiment. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, but I remember promises of making me better looking and poised before I passed out. Where was I before this? The bar\u2026 I think. It\u2019s a little hazy to be honest. The big guy sitting at the table in front of me has been no help at all. He barely bothers to look over from the newspaper in his hands, much less respond to me pleas for help. Nope. He just casually sat there with his feet up on the table and a pistol holstered just under his right shoulder. He may as well of been waiting for his wife to bring breakfast with that exhibition of ease, though I\u2019m sure his wife would probably slap him upside the head for ignoring a guest in such a manner. Suddenly, the man set the newspaper down on the desk and pulled back his suit sleeve to check the time. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I questioned, \u201cWhat is it time for!?!\u201d The man got up and made his way around the table toward me. \u201cWait\u2026 no\u201d, I continued, \u201cStay away\u2026\u201d He swiftly made his way over, I flinched and closed my eyes when he reached my side in fear he was about to harm me. Upon reopening my eyes, I noticed that he\u2019d walked right on by me. I could he him tinkering from behind. \u201cNo, no\u201d, I exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s just hold on a \u2013 \u201c The man interrupted my plea by stuffing a sock in my mouth and then covering it up with a gag ball on a strap. I could hear my muffled screams as he lowered the metal cap down onto my head. Moments later I could hear a door swing open behind me, followed be several emerging footsteps. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d A smooth, deep voice questioned behind me. \u201cTake a look for yourself, agent Black\u201d, a bland voice replied. The steps continued and then emerged a suave looking gentleman from my right side. He dressed from head to toe in a fine designer suit with impeccable fit and taste. He walked to my front, followed by a man in a white lab coat with glasses. The suave gentleman leaned in close to my face, his eyes were a nice hazel brown and his hair was stylishly gelled back and to the side. \u201cSorry, mate\u201d, the man exclaimed, \u201cThey seemed to have you in a rather poor state here I see\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, they seem to treat most our guest this way.\u201d He followed this with a big smirk and laugh, looking over at the man in the lab coat. He didn\u2019t reciprocate the gesture, but I heard a quick crackle to my right and noticed the same large man from earlier leaning his hand against my chair. The man in the lab coat looked off the large gentleman to my right before proclaiming, \u201cAgent Black, please don\u2019t make light of the situation\u2026 it\u2019s only that more degrading to our test subjects.\u201d Agent Black turned his back toward me and faced the man in the lab coat, who was now making his way around the table to where the large man was siting before. I noticed the large man to my right start inching closer to the agent, another large man emerging from my left doing the same. \u201cWhat exactly are you testing, Dr. Malvern?\u201d the agent questioned. \u201cWell your cover was blown, Agent Black\u201d, Dr. Malvern began to respond as the agent finally took note of the two large men now standing to either side of him, \u201cSo\u2026 we\u2019re going to put your mind in this man and then send you back out to the field.\u201d The agent looked over his shoulder at me before pointing his finger and then refocusing his eyes onto Dr. Malvern. \u201cYou\u2019re going to put me in him?\u201d he questioned, \u201cAnd then send me back out to the field?\u201d \u201cPrecisely\u2026\u201d Dr. Malvern replied, \"The Soviet don't know who this guy is... barely anyone does honestly.\" The agent began looking around frantically to the four faces placed on every side of him. I began to shake and yell through the gag again, now understanding exactly what was going on. \u201c\u2026But\u201d, the agent began to protest, \u201cI\u2019ve been going for eight years now\u2026 I was hoping to go home and see my family. Haven\u2019t I earned that much?\u201d \u201cI agree, you\u2019ve earned very much during your time\u201d, Dr. Malvern replied, \u201cFor instance, you\u2019ve earned a complete understanding of the entire inner working of the KGB\u2026 and we need you to continue doing so.\u201d The agent quickly threw backhanded fist toward the face of the man to his left, but the large gentleman grabbed him by the wrist and then delivered a blow to his left side. The agent then flailed toward the man to his left, but the other large gentleman had already grabbed his left arm and pinned it behind his back. The two men then dragged him to my left, the agent flailing his feet all the while. They pinned him down into the seat and began strapping him in one limb at a time. The agent spit into the face of the large man pinning him down from the front, and the man countered by punching him right in the nose. The other man was now standing behind the chair and secured the brace around the agent\u2019s neck. The two men then continued tightly fastening every strap as the agent slumped in the chair and slightly held his head back. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll take orders from you after this\u201d, the agent wailed, \u201cYou\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u201d Dr. Malvern crossed in front of me and made way over toward the agent, chuckling as he went along. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ways to get you working\u201d, Dr. Malvern replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a family\u2026 a wife and two kids.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u201d \u201cBut I would\u2026 and if I don\u2019t, then someone else would\u201d, Dr. Malvern replied sternly as he leaned in close to the agent, \u201cBesides\u2026 we\u2019ve developed ways to control you, agent.\u201d Dr. Malvern backed away and made his way around the table once again. He proclaimed before sitting down in his chair, \u201cThis machine is for more than just transferring minds\u2026 you see, it comes with the added benefit of controlling them as well.\u201d \u201cDamn yo \u2013 \u201c, the agent began to wail before he was muffled in a similar manner as I was. With that, one of the large men walked to the side of the table next to Dr. Malvern while the other man stayed out of site somewhere behind. \u201cPull the switch\u201d, Dr. Malvern exclaimed. Every muscle and cell in my body tensed up and then began to quiver. It felt like being shook in a small jar of water that was simultaneously being electrocuted. My vision switched from the white of the ceiling, to yellow splotches, until it finally settled on darkness when my eyes rolled to the back of my head. There was little thought in this all, just pure sensation. So much stimuli, that I stopped to feel all together.", "rewritten_text": "The leather straps binding my wrists and legs to the wooden chair emitted only a stained squeak as I tiredly fought against them. Despite being firmly fixed in position, I could still twist my mid-section side to side.

With my back pressed tightly against the chair and only my eyes free to move, I began to survey the room. The d\u00e9cor was minimal, facing a blank white wall without a visible door. Above me, a metal contraption resembling an archaic electric chair loomed with a chin strap. Straining my sight to the left, I could see a similar chair with pipes and cords connecting the two, hinting at an impending experiment.\n\nUncertain of my surroundings, I vaguely recalled being at a bar before this ordeal. The imposing figure seated at the table in front of me paid little attention, engrossed in a newspaper and indifferent to my pleas for help. He sat casually with his feet up, a pistol holstered under his right shoulder, seemingly unperturbed. As he set the newspaper down and checked the time, my anxiety grew. \"What is it?\" I questioned urgently, \"What is happening?\" Ignoring my protests, he advanced towards me, prompting me to recoil in fear of harm. However, he passed by me, focusing on something behind me.\n\nBefore I could comprehend the situation, a sock was shoved into my mouth, followed by a gag ball secured with a strap, muffling my screams.

The suave man expressed sympathy for my condition, remarking on the treatment of guests in this facility.\n\nDr. Malvern, the man in the lab coat, explained the plan to Agent Black, revealing a scheme to transfer the agent's mind into my body for covert operations. Agent Black, visibly distressed, protested, expressing a desire to return home to his family after years of service. Dr. Malvern emphasized the necessity of Agent Black's knowledge for their mission, despite his personal wishes. Tensions escalated as Agent Black resisted, leading to a physical altercation with the large men present.\n\nSubdued and strapped into the chair, Agent Black defiantly declared his refusal to comply.

Sir.\" Riku was snapped out of his thoughts as he admired the beautiful \"bush\" the locals had called it. Except it was something more beautiful, it was life all around them, it was precious, somehow along this almost desolate mountainous terrain a forest was able to grow here. A stream carved its way through the mountains giving everything around here a chance. Riku was a Sergeant in the Self Defence Force of Japan. That always made him laugh, Self Defence Force. Yet they were on foreign soil, being able to set up an outpost on the Northeast Shore of Australia. They called it the Northern Territory, at least that was what Intel labelled it as. They were sent to set up, a forward base before attacking the city of Darwin. Riku was leading his small squad on a scouting mission into the bush. The five man team hadn't ventured this far as they made their way down to a river. \"What is it Reo?\" Asked Riku, as he turned back to the rest of the squad. \"Tracks.\" He responded. Riku paced over quickly to Reo. Human tracks? No it couldn't be this far out, no sane person would ever live out here. As he looked over the tracks, it was clear they weren't human. Whatever they were was big, it looked like an oversized chicken. \"Boss.\" The eager and happy sounding voice Haruno broke the concerntration of Reo and Riku as they looked down studying the tracks. They looked up to see Haruno standing several meters ahead of thenm holding a rather large egg as he stood beside a nest. \"Chickens\" Riku smiled getting back to his feet. His parents had always had chickens around when he was growing up. They were wonderful, and he always loved to see them. Chickens this big though, well that would be a sight. One he could tell his parents all about. Then it happened. It was fast, too fast. Haruno was standing there for a moment and then he was in two. This large grey bird tore through Haruno in seconds with its large powerful foot. Riku had heard a lot about the dangers of Australia. Snakes, Spiders, this monster that lurked beneath the waters of rivers. Nothing.. nothing compared to the monster that stood before them. This oversized bird like creature was 6 foot tall had just eviscerated a human with one strike and now looked at the four men left standing. \"Bastard!\" Reo yelled as he pulled his rifle up to take aim at the large bird. His bullets tore through the air and into the large bird as it began to charge at him. The bird launched forward on its two strong legs, driving it's foot into Reo. Reo was smart enough to block it with his rifle, although he still had two large gashes in his chest from the claws on its feet. The bird was close and in between Riku and Ai now. Ai was more veteran, senior. He didn't care what this thing was, he was ready to put it down. He took a precise shot, aiming for its small head. At this range though, the creature stood no chance. His rifle had down its job. The large feathered beast fell to the ground with a thud. Neidama quickly ran to Reo who was crying out in pain. Riku had a moment, a second to collect himself and survey the scene. There was Reo, in pain, injured. There was, Haruno. At least what was left of him. His body in two halves, yet his hands still clasp the egg. An egg, this was a nest, they had stumbled upon. \"Spread out!\" Riku called out, but it was too late. The bushes around then rustled, the group was set upon by more of the large birds. They were blindingly fast, and powerful enough to disembowel a man with one kick. The first to fall was Daichi, then the creatures got to Neidama and Reo. Ai was more prepared. He was able to put down another creature before he fell. Riku took to cover quickly, collapsing down against a fallen tree as he heard the scurrying of feet and the calling out of pain, until it stopped. It all stopped, and the bush fell silent once again.", "rewritten_text": "\"Sir... Sir.\" Riku was snapped out of his thoughts as he admired the beautiful foliage the locals had referred to as a \"bush.\" However, it was more than just a bush to him; it symbolized life thriving in the almost desolate mountainous terrain. A stream meandered through the mountains, providing nourishment to the surrounding flora and fauna. Riku, a Sergeant in the Self Defence Force of Japan, found irony in the name of their organization \u2013 the Self Defence Force \u2013 as they were currently stationed on foreign soil, establishing an outpost on the Northeast Shore of Australia, known as the Northern Territory according to Intel. Their mission was to set up a forward base before launching an attack on the city of Darwin.\n\nLeading his small squad on a scouting mission into the bush, Riku and his team had ventured farther than before, reaching a river. \"What is it, Reo?\" Riku inquired, turning back to the rest of the squad. \"Tracks,\" Reo responded. Riku hurried over to Reo, doubting they were human tracks given the remote location. Upon closer inspection, the tracks appeared to belong to a large, bird-like creature, resembling an oversized chicken.\n\nInterrupting their examination of the tracks, Haruno's voice broke the concentration. He stood a few meters ahead, holding a large egg beside a nest. \"Chickens,\" Riku remarked with a smile, reminiscing about the chickens from his childhood. However, the peaceful moment was shattered when a massive grey bird swiftly attacked Haruno, tearing him apart in seconds with its powerful foot.\n\nThe danger of Australia that Riku had heard of \u2013 snakes, spiders, and river monsters \u2013 paled in comparison to the monstrous bird before them. As the bird turned its attention to the remaining four men, Reo retaliated by firing his rifle, followed by Ai taking a precise shot that brought down the creature. Despite the victory, the group was soon ambushed by more of the large birds, resulting in casualties among the squad.\n\nRiku, taking cover behind a fallen tree, listened as the chaos unfolded around him until the bush fell silent once more.\""}, "t1_dpjpmrt": {"original_text": "I said to my cloaked henchman. It had been a few days since I sent out the smile brigade and they were quite the hit! People were joyful in the streets, and had almost forgotten about the civil unrest and their new leader atop the throne. I had been planning my assualt for years. Starting out with my assassins training at an early age, to my leadership training in my mid teens and my military training as I left secondary school. My parents had prepared me for this, to take back what was rightfully theirs. But i was going to be different. I was going to be a gracious and joyful leader, i was going to make the world a happy place. I was most definitely not going to give up my throne, but i would make the people forget there was ever civil unrest! \"fetch me the joy committee\u200b\" I order my not so bright henchman. He meandered off down the dark hallway. What could we do next? Could we hire jesters to preform at every corner? Could we hire the magicians to create a rainbow that rained flavourful little candies over everyone (taste the rainbow)? The possibilities were endless and I had a committee to deal with it all! Besides, i had better things to do. Like how to decorate the inside of this musty old castle. Who ever painted the walls this hideous color of stone anyways... Before long the henchman was back, followed by my joy committee. All three of them smiling. Walking in order from tallest to smallest. The shortest of the three standing no taller than a door knob! Quite the sight he was. \"How can we server you Your Majesty\" stuttered the tallest. They were still getting used to addressing royalty. \"No need for all the formalities, call me Cornelius.\" I wanted them to feel comfortable with me. \"We need to spread some more joy. The smile brigade is working wonderfully but we need to do more! Have you come up with anything?\" \"But but.. Your maj... I mean Cornelius. We just got the smile brigade together early this week!\" \"I know that, but we need to do more. They need to know we are different than the other boring leaders!\" \"Don't you have other duties Cornelius?\" The little piped up. Tallest must have seen the fire in my eyes and he jumped in and shouted \"there must be something more we can do!\" My temper simmered a little bit but he had given me an idea... A terrible, but joyful idea! \"I want the three of you to stand on e each others shoulders in the main square for all the see!\" \"But cornelius, that seems a little unfair. We are the joy committee after all.\" \"And joy you must provide! I will have a costume made up for you at once! It will be three days from now and... Let me see.. I'm sure I can arrange some swords for you to juggle! You better start practicing!\" \"Yes your majesty!\" They all said in tandem \"Now go off and start practicing, three days goes quick you know!\" They shuffled their feet as they walked out the door. \"That will be the last time they question their leader\" i thought to myself happily, just as another thought poped in my head. \"Maybe I am no better than my parents.....? Absurd! They will love it and so will the people. Besides if they quit the committee I will have them be headed!\" My thoughts drifted as I hummed to myself quietly. \"Red drapes would go quite well with all this stone don't cha think?\" My henchman grunted his reply. \"Ill put up red drapes whether he likes it or not....\" Still humming happily....

Our town was an exit on the Interstate, and that kept enough traffic to keep places like the local fast food and 3 gas station/convenience stores in business. The Grill (So clever, right?) as they call it, started out as a breakfast and lunch place in one of the gas stations. Then, the others started showing up at night. They wanted food, but not roller taquitos of dubious origin or age, but fresh food. They were very persuasive in getting Bob the overnight assistant manager/keyholder to fire up the grill, but he really sucked at cooking So, one evening, a gentleman showed up at the fast food place where I worked evenings after school and ordered a huge order of food. I got everything together as quick as I could and made sure I didn't screw up on any of the details. My manager took note of everything I did, and promptly fired me and handed me a note saying I was to go up the street to the gas station with The Grill inside and work for them. He even paid me out what he owed me for the week in cash right there. His eyes had a strange look to them, but I didn't question the cash part and went home. I showed up at \"The Grill\" the next night. Bob the night manager looked at me and asked me what I wanted. I handed him the note. His face turned pale and he said, \"Oh, it's you they found. You cooked for them last night. I 'm really glad you're here. Fill out this form to get you set up in our payroll system, and your wage is filled in there.\" He pointed to a spot on the form. It was triple the current minimum wage! \"Wow! Thanks Bob! Had I known you paid this well, I would have come here long before now!\" I remarked as I filled in all of my information. \"We normally DON'T. You're making more than I do, kid. However, when they insist, you find that you cannot disobey.\" He shuddered. \"You shouldn't even try to disobey them. Just do what they ask of you and you'll be fine. But don't, like, talk to them, or bother them. Especially don't bother them.\" His hand was shaking as he took the clipboard with filled in paperwork from me. So that's how I met... Well, it's hard to explain. I call them, the old guys. They are... hard to focus on sometimes. But that's okay. They have always been super nice to me. Well, that I remember. I tried to have a conversation with the one who got me the job here and he initially didn't understand why I was talking to him. He asked me if I was not like the others on this plane, because I could look at him without running away screaming. Which I thought was hilarious. I mean, we aren't on a plane, we are in a restaurant, right? It wasn't like he was hideous. He was just this old man, like the others. Bob would often pull me aside when I would go check on them at their tables and refill their drinks or ask if they wanted anything else to eat and tell me I was tempting fate by talking to them. I think he was afraid that I would run them off by being too friendly or be seen as nosey. Most of the time, I couldn't even understand them as they talked to each other in like Ukrainian or maybe some form of an Asian language. It had weird syntax and the sounds were not like what we used in English. One night, they brought a book and were passing it around and discussing it in their conversations. It was really old. Then someone pulled out a paperback book from their jacket pocket and was comparing the text of the two. Their voices seemed really agitated as they discussed things, when my benefactor called me over to the table. \"Young one, come here please, hurry we might die of old age at any minute!\" he chuckled at his own joke and the others paused for a moment and started laughing with him. \"Please read this, and tell me what you think about it.\" He pointed at the paperback. \"Sure, let me take a look.\" I looked over at Bob who was shaking his head slightly in fear. \"I need to hold it, my eyes are bad.\" I picked up the paperback and took a quick look at the old book. It was written in a language, heck an ALPHABET that I didn't recognize. I read a passage they had pointed at on the page. It talked about the Eldritch ones and their using humans as pawns in their dominion over the Earth. I paused a moment and looked at the covers of the book. It looked like a cheap paperback that I would have found at the used bookstore in the county seat. \"I've not read this guy's stuff before. I think I'll find this for my Kindle.\" \"How did that make you feel reading it? \" They all leaned in toward me to hear my answer. \"Feel? I don't know. I ... I mean, I used to play Dungeons and Dragons back in High School and our DM, I mean Dungeon Master, tended to use just the Greek pantheon for our options for Clerics. It made it easier for us to grasp all of it.\" I shrugged. \"I think I get what they were talking about, but I am not really into this type of fantasy.\" \"Fantasy, you say, as in, not real?\" The benefactor seemed to chew on my use of the word pretty hard. \"Why do you call it fantasy?\" \"I mean, that's not real right? In the age of science, we 'd KNOW if there were ancient gods walking the Earth.\" I noticed Bob ran to the bathroom as I said that.

I efficiently prepared the order, impressing my manager. However, instead of praise, he promptly terminated my employment and handed me a note instructing me to work at the nearby gas station with The Grill. He paid me my owed wages in cash on the spot, with an odd look in his eyes.\n\nThe following night, I presented the note to Bob, the night manager at The Grill. He was relieved to see me, explaining that I had cooked for a mysterious group the previous night. Bob helped me complete the necessary paperwork, revealing that my wage was triple the minimum wage. Surprised by the generous pay, I filled out the form eagerly.\n\nBob cautioned me not to disobey the enigmatic group, referred to as \"the old guys,\" who frequented The Grill. Despite their intimidating presence and conversations in unfamiliar languages, they treated me kindly. Bob warned me against engaging with them too much, fearing I might upset them.\n\nOne night, the old guys discussed a book written in a language I couldn't identify. They asked me to read a passage from a paperback book, which spoke of ancient beings using humans as pawns. Unfamiliar with the content, I compared it to fantasy role-playing games I played in high school. The benefactor questioned my dismissal of the text as fantasy, prompting me to defend my skepticism of ancient gods walking the Earth in modern times.\n\nAs I expressed my disbelief, Bob abruptly excused himself, leaving me puzzled by his reaction."}, "t1_cpssrs8": {"original_text": "Sarah couldn't stop staring at him. Yeah, he was handsome, but he was an oaf. He lacked the creativity of other better men. He was lesser than one particular man who could really make Sarah happy, but she still loved him. She had barely spoken two words to him, but he blathered on and on about his charity work and how much he loved his little sisters and how he wanted to change the world. Jesus, the guy was revolting and was probably sexually perverted in some way. Sure, there was no real evidence of that, but, come on, this fucker wasn't so great. What did Sarah see in him? Yes, yes, there's the obvious. His family was rich. He was a literal prince, and he definitely looked the part. He had saved children from a fire a few years ago. I get it. He's somewhat special. Just looking at him, I want to throw acid in his face, his perfect damn face. Fuck you, Prince Charming. Fuck you! No, why is he getting up? He's walking toward Sarah. She stares at him in utter disbelief. He sits down across from her and holds her hand. If I had a bat, I'd break every bone in his body. She laughs at a joke. Yeah, it's funny. I get it. He's perfect. I know what you're thinking. I'm in love with Sarah, well, you're wrong. I'm just telling this story. Yes, Sarah is beautiful and smart and hilarious and kind and loving and giving and everything anyone would ever want in a partner. Yes, she transcends sexuality and so does he. Was I in love with the prince too? That hardly seems relevant to the story. Sarah finishes talking to him and she walks over to me. She sits down, about to burst with excitement. She can't contain it any longer. \"He asked me out. We're going to have coffee tomorrow. Then, I'll slip him the mickey, and you'll be waiting with the van right?\" \"Yep.\" She was already in love with him and so was I. It was so clear that things were going to go horribly wrong, but it was just a good ol' fashioned kidnapping for ransom. I hated him, but college was expensive.

He lacked the creativity and charm that she admired in other men. There was one man in particular who she believed could truly make her happy, yet she still harbored feelings for this man before her. Despite having exchanged only a few words with him, he prattled on about his charitable endeavors, his love for his younger sisters, and his aspirations to change the world. Sarah found his demeanor repulsive and suspected he might have some hidden perversions. While there was no concrete evidence to support her suspicions, she couldn't shake the feeling that he was not as great as he appeared to be. What was it about him that captivated Sarah? Well, the obvious answer was his affluent background. He was a literal prince, and his appearance certainly matched his royal status. Moreover, he had heroically rescued children from a fire a few years back. She understood his appeal, but she couldn't help but feel a sense of disdain towards him. As he rose from his seat and made his way towards Sarah, she watched in disbelief. He sat across from her, taking her hand, and she responded with laughter at his joke. Despite her reservations, she found herself drawn to him. Meanwhile, the narrator harbored intense animosity towards the prince, fantasizing about inflicting harm upon him. Sarah's elation was palpable as she approached the narrator, unable to contain her excitement. She revealed that he had asked her out for coffee the following day, hinting at a plan involving slipping him a mickey and orchestrating a kidnapping for ransom. The narrator begrudgingly agreed to participate in the scheme, driven by the exorbitant cost of college. As Sarah and the prince's relationship developed, the narrator's feelings towards him became increasingly complex. While harboring resentment towards him, the narrator found themselves entangled in a situation that was bound to end in chaos.

But a realistic one. Delphine, queen of the demon realm, had long terrorized the rest of the lands surrounding the kingdom. Until a hero arose to stop her. It hadn't been the first time someone had tried, by a long shot. And she always loved a fair fight. That was part of the thrill you see. But well, upon facing said hero in the final throes of battle, one thing led to another. And well... One year and a lot of handholding later, here the queen sat, tenderly swaddling a little bundle of joy. But that question definitely brought up a lot of unspoken things. \"I don't know.\" Delphine answered, her wings quietly unfurling slightly. \"I never thought I'd make it this far.\" This seemed to puzzle the orc more than she realized. And eventually she let the baby rest from her coddling for a moment to study him. \"Well, you wanted a child.\" Texios grumbled carefully. \"I didn't know if I did at first.\" She went on. \"But I did.\" They watched their little one as he quietly fidgeted with his blanket. He had his mother's claws, and his father's tusks. Both of their eyes. \"The villages will not like this.\" Texios pointed out. \"And the first of them to try my patience will burn to the ground.\" She happily promised. \"I'm serious.\" Texios soured. \"You know what they will call him.\" \"An abomination. A devil.\" She replied, quietly cuddling her son again. \"They will hate him for as long as he lives.\" There was another long stretch of silence from him as he watched the skies. One of Delphine's imps carefully backed away from the pair of them. He'd apparently come to deliver a message. But he sensed it was not the time, and quickly made his leave via the balcony. \"You were the 'Chosen One'. Perhaps you could convince them.\" \"I was the Chosen One, because you killed the other ones.\" \"They had it coming.\" Texios had to chuckle as this, as he polished off his battle axe with a calloused thumb. \"Besides. There are bigger things to worry about.\" \"I'm hearing stories of strange things to the south.\" She explained. \"The dead walk with the living.\" \"I see.\" \"Perhaps an army to face my own?\" \"Perhaps.\" He turned now to take his son from her arms, if only to look at him for himself. \"We need to be ready. He needs to be ready.\" She seemed to think about it. The spell she conjured quickly showed her a glimpse of what her messenger sent. Bodies of heroes long dead and freshly slain, rising from the grave. Hands clawing at dirt. A man behind them atop a hill. \"I have some friends in the Gnolls. And my tribe.\" Texios suggested. \"We could send him there. Teach him to fight.\" \"And let him miss out on my alchemy, and spellbinding?\" Delphine reacted. \"Please.\" \"If spells don't work, he needs to fight.\" There was further talk about this as their son absently began tossing small fireballs at the floor. With his mother absently putting them out of course. The Dragon Kingdom was a no-fly zone from the start. They didn't care about the rest of the world, and would decimate visitors just to prove the point. The mortal realms were hostile in their own ways, but scattered and when isolated, lawless and almost harmless. And then there was the elven kingdom to the south. No news made both of them wonder what the prophecy she received meant. But this was interrupted by a squeal as their kid began choking out another imp, before dad intervened. Texios simply burst into rough laughter as he watched the small demon limp away. \"I don't get what's so funny.\" Delphine said shaking her head. \"We're not in danger.\" He noted as their son bit his hand playfully. \"Everyone else is.\" Subversion of typical fantasy is fun. r/Jamaican_Dynamite", "rewritten_text": "\"What happens now?\" It was an awkward question, given the circumstances, but a realistic one.

However, in the final moments of battle against the hero, something unexpected happened. And now, a year later, the queen found herself tenderly cradling a little bundle of joy. The question raised many unspoken thoughts. \"I don't know,\" Delphine replied, her wings unfurling slightly. \"I never thought I'd come this far.\" This seemed to puzzle the orc more than she realized, and she paused to study the baby. \"Well, you wanted a child,\" Texios remarked cautiously. \"I wasn't sure at first,\" she continued. \"But now I am.\" They observed their child, who bore his mother's claws, his father's tusks, and both of their eyes. \"The villages won't approve,\" Texios pointed out. \"And the first to test my patience will face destruction.\" Delphine vowed. \"I'm serious,\" Texios warned. \"They will brand him an abomination, a devil,\" she replied softly, cuddling her son. \"They will despise him for as long as he lives.\" As they watched in silence, an imp approached with a message but wisely retreated without delivering it. \"You were the 'Chosen One'. Perhaps you could persuade them,\" Texios suggested. \"I was chosen because you eliminated the others,\" she retorted. \"They deserved it,\" Texios chuckled, polishing his battle axe. \"Besides, there are greater concerns.\" \"I've heard rumors of strange occurrences to the south,\" she informed him. \"The dead walk among the living.\" \"I see.\" \"Perhaps we need an army to face this threat,\" she mused. Texios took their son from her arms to examine him. \"We must be prepared. He must be prepared.\" After discussing sending their son to the Gnolls for combat training, Delphine hesitated, considering her own magical teachings. \"If magic fails, he must know how to fight,\" Texios insisted. As they deliberated, their son playfully conjured fireballs, with his mother extinguishing them. The Dragon Kingdom was off-limits, the mortal realms were chaotic but manageable, and the elven kingdom to the south remained a mystery. Their conversation was interrupted by their son's antics, causing Texios to laugh heartily. \"I don't see what's amusing,\" Delphine said, puzzled. \"We may not be in danger, but others are,\" Texios observed as their son playfully bit his hand.

Of course, the tech was top secret and not even the Russian Prime minister knew of it, though the Russian president naturally did know. And this maniac saw it as a way to shake the core of western civilization. The message was broadcasted globally. as for the site, no matter the identification you gave it, the answer would be Hell. Most of whom English was the second language mainly wondered why it was in English, and those that didn't even speak it were puzzled what was even said. Well, things weren't that great for some states. The British were going crazy, not cause they were going to hell but because the message was in a Polish accent. Half of Scotland was enraged at \"God\" for speaking such incomprehensible gibberish. And London went completely ham, within the hour there was a priest pronouncing the poles as the chosen peoples. And that was just some crazy, but the Americans, they were a story all together. Half of America pronounced the apocalypse and anarchy. Those ragged crazy folks screaming 'the end is near' became an authority in an instant, some even called Messiah before the next church bells rang. But that fool in charge if this hotbed of religious chaos, the so called leader of the free world, earned himself another name that day. To all those that managed to survive his actions, he became known as the Harbinger of the endtimes. The one that brought the scorched winter, the last summer. Those that did survive tell his tale, so that when humans once again reach the height of old, we know, never react to fear with fire. And justify your actions in this life. For it was the fear of Hell that ended the world, and hellfire that was it's tool. The Harbinger believed that if he would go to Hell, and his actions didn't matter anymore, he might as well open the gates of Hell to let it swallow the world. And devour it did. The fires started in the west, but ser aflame in the east. The sparks from the east spread to the rest of the world, and soon engulfed us all. Now we, the chosen, the living, the damned, we walk on the green stones, and the dead fields, drink from glowing rivers and die underneath the black sky.

While you do that the spell finishes casting and the room starts to tremble as cracks spread across the room.\" \"Oh crap I forgot we were underground.\" Brent finally comes back to us and I think he understands what I'm doing. Shit I'm just going to have to wing it. \"I want to sprint back to the room with the alter and shout for everyone to follow.\" \"I'm guessing everyone follows? If you don't say so. Alright so the door to that hasn't caved in yet so you can make it back there easily, though the Shadow Tripbip follows you.\" \"I shout to everyone else.

A few moments later, Kralzug, you notice a floating bone crown resembling the one worn by the Arch Emperor Lich King, with your friend Ella underneath it.\" \"I grin, wave at Kralzug, and put it on,\" Ella declared. I had only seen Daniel this ecstatic a few times before, usually preceding a party wipe or a Reddit front-page post. The odds of another viral post seemed slim this time. \"You place the crown on your head and feel nothing... until you witness shadows emerging from the Lich King's corpse, forming into a giant, displeased Tripbip,\" Daniel narrated. \"Well, now that we're facing imminent death by a giant halfling shadow, I cast Earthquake, ensuring we're out of the area of effect,\" Sam announced. It seemed Daniel's chances of another viral post were indeed slim. Perhaps a Half-Orc bard for my next character, considering our impending demise. Whether the giant shadow Tripbip or Sam's earthquake spell would be our downfall remained uncertain. \"Okay, I want to sprint to the dead body and search for a magical object that fits the altar we found earlier,\" I decided. \"You find a fist-sized rock with carved runes that seems to match. Meanwhile, the earthquake spell completes, causing the room to tremble,\" Daniel described. \"Oh, I forgot we were underground,\" Brent finally re-engaged, realizing the situation. \"I sprint back to the altar room and urge everyone to follow,\" I shouted. \"Assuming everyone follows, you make it back to the room easily, with the Shadow Tripbip in pursuit,\" Daniel narrated. \"I yell to the others, 'Kralzug will defeat Shadow Tripbip and save us!

I engage in combat, retreating a bit each turn,\" Brent declared, attempting to convey his plan. \"Okay, Kralzug, as you battle Shadow Tripbip, you notice the throne room collapsing, with cracks approaching. The rest of you reach the altar,\" Daniel described. \"As soon as I reach the altar, I insert the stone,\" I declared. \"Instantly, a purplish portal appears before you, as the tomb begins to crumble,\" Daniel narrated. The plan worked, saving everyone once again, though the portal's destination remained unknown. \"I instruct the others to enter the portal and call out to Kralzug to join us, then follow through myself,\" I directed. \"Do either of you hesitate?\" Daniel inquired. \"I wait for Delaranthian to enter before following,\" Ella responded. \"I go through as well. How bad is the tomb collapsing?\" Sam asked. \"In a matter of minutes, the entire tomb and connecting caves will be rubble,\" Daniel informed, observing their reactions. \"Did I hear that?\" Sam inquired. \"Yes, you did,\" Daniel confirmed. \"I jump in the portal after the others,\" Sam decided. \"Understood,\" Daniel acknowledged. \"I cease fighting and rush through the portal to safety,\" Brent declared triumphantly. \"You'll incur an attack of opportunity,\" Daniel warned. \"That's fine,\" Brent shrugged. \"Tripbip attempts to strike you, but you evade and escape into the fading portal just in time.

We froze, exchanging uncertain glances. \"You locked the doors, right, Jake?\" Daniel inquired, seeking reassurance. All eyes turned to me, awaiting my response. Had I locked the door? With my family out, it should have been secured. Was it the cat or an earthquake, ironically enough? \"Um, yeah, I think so. It's probably just the wind. If you're concerned, go check,\" I suggested. \"I'm thirsty; I'll come along,\" Brent volunteered. A minute later, Brent's exclamation of 'holy shit!' was followed by a gruff voice demanding, 'Who are you, Human!? And what is this place?'

For twelve hours, he had done nothing but read every piece of information he could find on the rules that came with his calling. The basics were simple and well-publicized: wings, bow, arrows, and the power to strike people with instantaneous (but real and permanent) love. But there was maddeningly few specifics on the Management side of the process. How does selection happen? Why are local snipers employed to be given assignments rather than upper-level staff in Management? Why can each sniper only strike one individual per assignment - to keep, as the manual says, \"the balance\"? He stared down at the red spiral notebook and flipped to the first page. Items to Clarify Before Moving Forward. He was not generally one to take risks, but time was running out. An assignment could come at any time and he wanted to be ready to move forward. Fabric brushed against the back of his neck; someone was behind him. He tried to swing around and knocked his notebook and pen from the table. His wife stepped in front of him, her hands raised high and a grin spreading across her face. He smiled sheepishly and turned to stand, but before he could Marcia pushed his shoulders down firmly and began kneading the tight knots of muscle that clustered together in his upper back. He groaned loudly. \"You are never allowed to stop.\" \"Mo-om!\" Their youngest daughter called from down the hall. Marcia leaned down closer to his desk and dropped an unmarked letter on his keyboard as she leaned in to kiss the bald spot on the top of his head. His stomach cramped as he glanced at the familiar envelope. \"You feeling ready?\" she asked, staring down at him from above. \"I think I'm as ready as I can be... but there are no guarantees. I've never broken protocol before...but then again, who knows if there is any reason for their rules. I can't see what could go wrong though.\" \"What you're doing is right,\" Marcia said confidently. \"I think you should go for it.\" As she turned to leave, Lester spun around in his chair and pulled her gently onto his lap. She laughed as he buried his head in her thick, auburn hair, which fell in waves down her back that smelled of cocoa butter and... \"Pasta sauce?\" She laughed wearily as he ran his fingers through a crusted strand of hair. \"Tomato basil soup,\" she answered. \"Lily hates it.\" As she began to get up, his arms tightened around her waist, tugging her in the opposite direction. Her laugh lilted musically as she wriggled to extricate herself, before finally slipping out and racing to the doorway. \"Take it easy, my love...\"she said. \"Save your energy for the people who need it - those who don't have what we do.\" Their eyes met and her face lit up. A second later she was gone, off to listen to their youngest declare with grave sincerity that a hairbrush is an implement of torture. He turned his attention to the envelope which held his 1545th assignment since he took the oath. Ten years ago he would have been thrilled to receive an assignment, to do his duty. Now he read it grimly and prepared. So much had changed. But he didn't have to. Lester's right arm ached as he pulled back on his bow for the 15th time, swiveling his head to check that no one could see him. The two sixteen-year old kids listed in the letter weren't hard to find. On the contrary, they were putting on quite the show from the back of a 1992 Ford Escort. They had parked at an empty community park and Lester had been lying on top of a nearby facilities building for over an hour, waiting for the flailing of limbs to stop long enough to get a good look. The back left window was down, but it still wasn't an easy shot. He kept getting so close that he was pulling back on his bow when they would roll into some new position and he would have to reset. Eventually he gave up, not willing to risk a shot until one of them left the car. Why them? As usual, the question began bouncing around his head, a constant companion during stakeouts. Last month he finally approached the management liaison, nervously sputtering out his concerns to a well-coiffed representative. The rep stared blankly as he introduced himself and explained his concerns. Erratic choices for selection. No clear reasons. Other alternatives that have demonstrated more hardship. Management seems to have lost sight of the greater good in this particular task. The rep's expression remained unchanged and the only indication he made that he had heard Lester was to nod so slightly it was almost imperceptible. He removed a tablet from his satchel and tapped/swiped/tapped until a robotic voice began speaking. \"Your duties do not include selection. If you are unable to complete your duties as assigned, report back for removal from this post.\" A few heavy thuds echoed across the soccer field that lay between Lester and his targets. Fog had clouded every one of the clunker's windows and Lester sat back, keeping his bow in position while staring at the car door for any sign of movement. After a few moments of stillness, he glanced down at the list he had brought with him. His selection list. These kids don't deserve a sniper, he thought as he scanned the first page. They're consumed with lust at this age anyway, there's no room for love. He closed the notebook triumphantly; for the 100th night in a row he had concluded that every name on his list would have been a better use of resources than the night's assignment. And tonight he was finally ready to do something about it. Sam Hirschman turned and waved before entering the park bathroom, worried that if he left for too long Jennifer, who was the hottest girl he had ever gotten into the Escort, would disappear, returning to the recesses of his imagination. He hastily dug out a joint from his pocket and lit it before taking position at the urinal. He sprayed the wall with a stream of urine that traced three and a half lop-sided circles before it instantaneously ceased. Sam doubled over, coughing and gasping for air as he collapsed onto the wet floor. He'd tell Jennifer later that it felt like a semi truck driving 90 miles an hour slammed striaght into his upper back and exploded. In the 20 minutes it took Jennifer to check on and find Sam, the arrow wound had healed completely, leaving only one sign of Lester that would be there forever: a 2 inch by 2 in ch patch of charcoal scar tissue that formed a perfect arrowhead. It took Lester less than an hour to hit his next target - the very first name on his list. Every detail came together according to plan, and exactly 47 minutes after he left Sam he sprinted to Mrs. Andrews' window. He watched her from the fire escape, quelling the urge to run back in and help the struggling 67-year-old woman who he had left prostrate in her kitchen. He stayed there for twenty minutes, teeth gritted as he watched her struggle for air. When she finally pulled herself up to sit, Lester let out a joyful yell that sent him flying up the fire escape. It was the only time he had ever been close to blowing his cover, but it was for good reason. His selection had gone off without a hitch. His choice had been careful, his research meticulous, his execution exact. Mrs. Andrews had never recovered from the death of her husband. And in ten years she had spent more nights than not alone with the sorrow that had become her companion. When a new tenant moved in, an older gentleman who had lost his wife to cancer a year back, Mrs. Andrews didn't think much of his invitations to tea or offer to help her carry groceries. But Lester set his sights on a future she couldn't yet see. He was still high on the success of his first solo operation when he burst through the door to his apartment. He woke up all three of his daughters, kissed each on the forehead and loudly proclaimed his love for them, shouting down sleepy protests. He poured a glass of wine for he and Marcia and carried it into their room with a slice of her favorite cheesecake - penance for coming home late and waking her up. He knew she wouldn't mind though - she would be eager to hear that he had taken next steps to do what Management was not up to. Lester tapped the door lightly with his knuckles as he nudged it open, trying to avoid startling her awake. As the door swung open, he turned to see Marcia, wide awake and fully dressed, standing next to their closet. \"Love? Is everything alright?\" She had something in her hand. She shoved it towards him like it was burning her and before he could reach out in time it spilled to the ground, clinking loudly against their bed frame. He keeled to pick up whatever she had discarded and froze when he saw, just below their dust cover, what looked like her wedding band. \"I \u2026 I can't do this anymore\u2026 I\u2019m leaving. And I want a divorce.\" Lester crumpled to the floor, dazed as his wife wheeled her suitcase of packed clothing in front of him and left their apartment. Before he could gather the composure to stop her, he heard her shoes cross their kitchen tile. Six clicks was all it took her to cross to the front door and not enough time for him to prepare for hearing it slam shut, leaving him alone. He lay motionless on their bedroom floor, waiting for her to come back, to explain. How long had she felt this way? Why wouldn't she have told him? His mind was racing - when was the last time we even fought? She hasn't seemed distant - have I been distant to her? His throat tightened. Is it someone else? He searched their bedroom for clues, for anything she had left behind. He found a beige lipstick. A business card for a Harry Leonardson. An old web cam she had used during the two years they were long-distance before getting married. A tear spilled onto the giant, old web cam and Lester wound up and threw it with all of his force at the window. The glass shattered with a soothingly appropriate level of noise.", "rewritten_text": "Lester gazed wearily at his computer screen, his eyes bloodshot from twelve hours spent absorbing every detail about the rules of his calling. The basics were clear: wings, bow, arrows, and the ability to strike people with instantaneous, yet real and lasting, love. However, the specifics on the Management side were frustratingly scarce. How was selection made? Why were local snipers tasked with assignments instead of higher-level Management staff? And why could each sniper only strike one individual per assignment to maintain \"the balance,\" as the manual stated?\n\nHe looked down at the red spiral notebook, flipping to the first page labeled \"Items to Clarify Before Moving Forward.\" Though not one to take risks, time was ticking, and an assignment could arrive at any moment. Fabric brushed against his neck, signaling someone's presence behind him. Startled, he knocked his notebook and pen off the table as his wife appeared, hands raised in a playful gesture. She began massaging his tense muscles, prompting a loud groan from him.\n\nTheir daughter's voice interrupted, and as his wife left a letter on his keyboard, she encouraged him to be prepared. With a mix of uncertainty and determination, Lester contemplated breaking protocol for the first time. His wife reassured him, urging him to follow his instincts.\n\nAs she departed, Lester pulled her onto his lap, seeking comfort in her presence. Their playful exchange was interrupted by the familiar envelope containing his 1545th assignment. Reflecting on the changes over the years, he steeled himself for the task ahead.\n\nLester's arm ached as he aimed his bow for the 15th time, hidden from view as he observed two teenagers in a car. Frustrated by the lack of clarity in Management's decisions, he recalled a futile attempt to address his concerns with a representative. The encounter only reinforced his isolation in executing assignments that seemed arbitrary and devoid of purpose.\n\nWatching his targets from a distance, Lester wrestled with his conscience, questioning the morality of his actions. Despite his reservations, he resolved to act on his convictions, determined to make a difference.\n\nThe scene unfolded as planned, with Lester's precise execution leaving a lasting impact on his target. His success brought a mix of satisfaction and unease, signaling a shift in his perspective on his duties.\n\nReturning home elated, Lester's joy was short-lived as a devastating revelation shattered his world. His wife's abrupt departure and declaration of divorce left him reeling, grappling with unanswered questions and a sense of betrayal.\n\nAlone in their bedroom, surrounded by remnants of their life together, Lester's turmoil culminated in a moment of despair.

The man freaked out seeing you just appear out of no where and slammed the brakes. My head hit the back of his seat and lights seemed to flash in my eyes as the guy jumped out of the car and moved to the back door. A quick jerk and the door was opened as he reached in and pulled me out. He began demanding something of me but I wasn't listening as I swung my knee up without thinking and kneed him in the gut. He dropped me and I scrambled back before anger flowed threw my mind, I punched him hard in the nose breaking it and dazing him as he fell to his ass on the side of the road. I grabbed my cell phone and called the cops who showed up a around ten minutes later. It took me days to get home and by the time I did my job had called me and fired me for missing work, yet again. I ignored it for a moment and began doing a search about the guy and kid I had met. The guy was claiming someone had attacked him when he was trying to help the boy, the boy claimed an angel had help him. The boys parents where happy he was back, he had been taken by the man for unreleased purposes. The only help me cope with it all was that I had saved the boy. Months went by without me using my powers as I tried to find someway to help but also still have a life to make it worth it all. Then one lazy Saturday while working at the local Bar I accidentally tapped the bar four times trying to get a customers attention. I hadn't tapped anything for awhile but this time was pure accident as I remembered not to do it as I did it only able to say one word before I vanished in front of nearly fifty people, \"shit.\" I arrived and heard a gun shot go off, I spun and saw a man holding a gun so I did what I felt was right and threw the tray I had at him like an over sized Frisbee. I was dizzy and looked behind me to find a couple with a young son and daughter pushed behind them looking at me stunned. \"You okay?\" I asked in a slurred voice and the world tilted as I began to fall. My body slamming into the alley as the sound of sirens grew louder. A man in a foreign language began speaking to me and pressing on my chest once he had be face up. I reached a shaking hand out and tapped the alley four times as he tried to yell for something before I vanished. I appeared over a table and fell onto it.

It is a heavy thing, a weight beyond measure. I am the oldest man alive. I was born in time to see the last of the Roman Empire crumble into ruin. By all means, I should have died when the chariots of those foreign savages rolled through my town, crushing the dried autumn leaves beneath their hard, wooden wheels. But I did not die then. Iron forged for bloodshed, diseases that eat the skin off of your bones, the failing of the body under the relentless rolling of Time; none of these touched me. I have lived nearly fifteen hundred years, impervious to all harm. Yet, despite all this, I have carried the heaviest burden for one and a half millennia; the fear of Death. Why should the undying fear death? I have dreams, yes. I've had thousands. Tens of thousands - all forgotten. But once in a very long time, when I lay down on the ground, or in a lice-infested bunk, or whatever resting place life has provided for me, when I close my eyes, I am struck with a powerful vision. This vision I can never forget. Through clouds of thick, ashen smoke, I hear a growl. It is distant, even ignorable, at first, until the clouds part. The black, hard carapace shifts behind the smog, and the growling becomes a roar - a roar that splits my head apart, that bears down on me from all angles, until I am smothered by the smoke and I do not know where to run. And then the smokey, ashen clouds part, and I see the Beast. And I know that it is Death. Do you know what it is like to carry this one, single fear - not knowing what it means - for as long as I have? It grates on your soul. It shreds you with doubt. In the moment before I died, I saw the vision. I was walking with my youngest daughter - she was an accident - a girl who was once small enough to sit on my knee. Now, she is almost so small once again - though, not nearly as full of life. She held on to my arm, clutching me for stability, as we walked, step by tired step, through the square of the town. Through her eyes, I could see the wonders of the world anew. To her, as we walked through the widening streets, paved with dirt and gravel, it was all special, this astonishing, relentless progress of mankind. To me, it was filled with incomprehensible demons, ghosts from the future. I had seen these buildings before, almost fifteen hundred years ago. I had seen the Empire that built them collapse like a man struck down by some unseen assailant in a pitch-black alley. As we wandered down the street, my daughter's old bones creaking and cracking, me trying to urge her onward, I had a feeling, like I was being watched. I looked to the windows, and saw no faces - only empty, glassy panes, and thin, metallic chimneys sticking up like the legs of a beetle on it's back. Smoke poured up from those chimneys, until the sun was a greasy mirage, struggling to touch the ground. She grew a stubborn girl, which might have been my fault, and remained obstinate in her aging years. No amount of encouraging or coaxing could move her faster. Yet as we wandered under the eaves of the buildings, I knew the feeling would not shake. I knew I was stuck with it. But it was not until we walked into the shop - the wooden doors swinging wide, displaying the highest fashion of the Old Continent, mingled with the strange frontier leathers and beads and animal things of the New - that I realized what the feeling was. The floor was rumbling, as if it was growling. In the dank, dim air of the shop, I knew the Beast was near. There was a shape, in front of a curtained window. I espied only a silhouette, but it was huge, and it's vast, muscular form loomed over me. It threatened to swallow me whole with it's black, glossy eyes. The Burden of Fear turned my feet to stone. I stumbled backwards, distantly, I could hear the soft tones of my daughter's voice - Father? What's wrong? - but I could not answer. I tumbled out of the shop, the doors screaming as they swung close behind me - and I fell into the streets. There, sprawled on the ground, my body bruised as much as it could be, I struggled to stand. The ground rumbled beneath my feet - and clouds of smoke billowed around me, choking me. Swallowing me. The Beast was not in the shop at all. It was outside, waiting for me, it's shining, black carapace, bearing down on me. It ran, not on legs, but on wheels, like the chariots they once used to crush my old country, all those hundreds of years ago. As the sting of the metal kissed my skin, slicing me apart not with razor metal, but with shear force, I felt something that I had not expected.

God damn, my alarm clock was never this loud. My eyes crawl open, my vision hazy. They struggle to adjust to the light as I sit up in my cot. My cot? Something isn't right. My vision comes into focus and I find myself staring down at a grimy concrete floor, full of cracks and streaked with dirt. I look to my side and see a filthy, thin mattress atop a metal frame. A stench of body odor, urine, and god knows what else wafts into my nose and I nearly gag. This isn't right at all. Where the hell am I? Still recoiling from the odor, I look up into the face of a large tattooed man in an orange jumpsuit sitting on a cot across from mine. He's staring me dead in the eyes and clutching a boot in one hand. On his face he wears a look of sheer terror. \"Hey, what is this place?\" I attempt to ask him, but my voice is so hoarse I'm only able to grunt before bursting into a fit of coughing. The man starts at the sounds and inches farther onto his cot, the clutch on his boot tightening. I manage to clear my throat and ask, \"What is this place? Where am I?\" \"You stay the hell away from me, alright?\" he stammers in a Southern drawl, sliding even farther away from me until his back is up against the wall. \"Hey, what's the matter? What are you so afraid of?\" I'm growing ever more nervous by the second. If this thug is so afraid of this place...afraid of me?...what the hell is going on?! \"Listen, I know what you've done, what you're capable of, and you're not taking me down, too. Just STAY AWAY FROM ME!\" his voice cracks as the fear on his face grows ever more intense. I notice deep bags under his eyes and realize he's probably spent the whole night cowering on that cot, brandishing a boot. \"Buddy, I wish I knew what you were talking about,\" I reply, \"but honestly, I have no idea what's going on.\" \"Oh, is that right?\" he spits back at me. \"No idea? Just like all those people last week had no idea? I mean, god damn, I've done some awful things in my life, and I'm doing my time, but you...you're a monster! You're a god damn monster!\" He's nearly screaming at this point, his face growing red with the exertion. \"There were kids there, man! Fuckin' kids!\" \"Hey!\" I shout at him. His eyes grow wider and he curls into a ball, tears starting to stream down his face. \"Calm down, man, Jesus! There's been some mistake, I have no clue what you're talking about! Last thing I remember, I was at a bar downtown with two of my friends. I might have had a few too many drinks, but I was about to call a cab home when I blacked out. That's all I know, I swear to God. So please, just work with me here...where the fuck am I?\" \"Take a wild guess, Sherlock,\" he says, gesturing to his left. I look where he's pointing, and for the first time notice the bars blocking the entrance to what I've finally realized is a cell. \"I'm in jail?! Shit, what the hell happened? Is this the drunk tank, or what? Did I really have that much to drink?\" My mind is racing, trying to comprehend how I could have possibly wound up here. This can't be the drunk tank. It's just the two of us in here. This is bad, this is really, really bad. My companion's gaze softens ever so slightly. \"I can't tell if you're serious or if you're really so deranged that you just can't help lyin' to people. Honestly it wouldn't surprise me, you fucking freak.\" \"Come on! Why would I make this up? I seriously don't know how I got here.\" \"Well, you'll find out soon enough, shit-head!\" a gruff voice bellows from the hallway. \"Come on, it's breakfast! Get your asses up!\" I look towards the bars and see a bald man dressed like a police officer unlocking the cell door and holding 2 pairs of handcuffs. \"Officer! Thank god you're here, there's been a mistake! I don't know-\" \"Shut up!\" he interrupts with a shout. \"I'm no officer, son. I'm a guard, and as a guard, I have a different code of ethics. First thing you need to know about Hopkins is that you speak when you're spoken to here. You people are scum, and here, we treat you as such! Now stand up and come with me!\" He swings the door open and immediately slaps handcuffs on both our wrists. \"I'm not going with him,\" my cellmate says in a hushed tone. \"Too bad, Hornsby! It's 6:30 AM, which means it's breakfast, which means every second you waste sittin' on your lily ass, my coffee gets colder, and if I don't get my coffee, you don't get rec time! Do I make myself clear?!\" Hornsby glances up at the guard, then back at me, then at the guard again. Finally, he sets down his boot, unclenches his hands, and stands up, staying as far away from me as possible. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Good! Now get movin, pretty boy!\" He attaches a chain to both our cuffs and pulls hard, leading us into the corridor and toward the mess hall. He leads us past other cells, empty of inmates, and joins a slow-moving group of men all clad in orange and led by other guards.

Shit, last night went much worse than I thought. The guard attaches our chain to the chains of the mass ahead of us and steps to the side, keeping pace. I nudge an inmate ahead of me and whisper, \"Psst! Hey, man, what is this place?\" The man turns around with anger in his eyes, and quietly says, \"Shut the fuck up! You tryin' to land in solitary?\" He turns forward and I nudge him again. \"Quit it, man! This is fuckin' Hopkins, they don't play nice here!\" He looks in my eyes and suddenly, the anger turns to fear. He faces forward and quickens his pace, bumping into other inmates, trying to get through the crowd. What the hell? This guy, too? \"Hey, watch it!\" someone ahead shouts as the man keeps pushing, throwing himself at the others, trying in vain to get as far away from me as possible. The other inmates are starting to get angry, and the guards, noticing the commotion, pull weapons from their belts and move forward to stop the mayhem from spreading. \"Everybody, stop where you are! You have 3 seconds before everyone here gets sent back to their cells!\" The writhing crowd freezes, save for the man still trying to get away. One of the inmates, an enormous bald man covered in swastika tattoos, pushes him over, and looks my way in fury, trying to determine what caused his panic. Once he sees my face, the same look of terror spreads across his, and he, too starts pulling at his chains and pushing people out of the way. \"EVERYBODY FUCKING FREEZE!\" The guards have their weapons drawn now, firing tasers into the crowd, beating people in the sides with billy clubs. Their efforts are in vain, more and more people are noticing me, and every face that turns my way looks terrified. The thrashing mob is pulling me forward by the wrists and tugging me every which way, until finally... The chain snaps. Um...okay. I turn around and make a run for it. Now's my chance to get away, the guards are distracted and no one is paying attention to me. I'm going to find someone in charge and finally get this whole mess figured ou- My wrists are yanked backwards, as my whole body contorts and I fall to the ground, hard. Shit, I forgot about Hornsby. He's stayed frozen in place, his terrified gaze now looking as if it's permanently marred his features. \"Hands up, maggot!\" The guard who opened our cell is heading towards me, taser drawn. His coffee is most certainly cold. \"No, wait, please!\" I beg, \"this is all a mistake! I don't know why I'm here, you have to-\" My body convulses as 50,000 volts of electricity are pumped through me. As my vision fades to black, the last thing I hear is a frantic cry of, \"Please, I'll go to solitary, I'll clean latrines for a month, just get me away from him!\" ... I'm standing in a narrow alleyway, rain pouring down around me. There's a single light overhead, flickering and buzzing. A dark figure stands at the other end, pointing a gun square at my chest. \"This is it, Jack,\" he says. \"Give me the detonator and we can forget any of this ever happened.\" I don't know what to say...but apparently that isn't a problem. \"Fuck off, Donny,\" I find myself saying, my words slurred. \"This was bound to happen and you know it.\" \"Jack,\" he's pleading, \"this isn't like you! I've known you for years, you've always been the kindest person I've ever known! Think of your family, Jack!\" He sounds on the verge of tears. \"Think of Sally, think of your kids! What are they going to think about you if you go through with this? Please, Jack...just give me the detonator. We can make this right, but you have to work with me. Just hand it over. Please...\" He extends his other hand, slowly. \"It's too late for that, Donny!\" I say, realizing my arm is bent at the elbow. I'm holding a tiny black box in my hand, with a single switch that says simply: \"ARM.\" \"You knew it was too late when you decided to spread lies about me!\" \"What are you talking about?! Come on, you're my best friend! I would never-\" \"You slandered my name!\" I scream, \"You called me a thief and a coward! You made a fool of me in front of the whole board of directors! Well, now I'm going to make it right.\" \"Jack, don't do this!\" \"The ends justify the means, Donny, you slimy fucker. This is where it ends.\" \"Jack, no!\" I flip the switch. The ground shakes below me as an earth-shattering blast nearly ruptures my eardrums. I lose my footing and start to fall, but then a second blast sounds off, much closer. There is a sharp pain in my forehead, and I hear myself scream as the world goes black.", "rewritten_text": "Part 1: I awaken to the blaring sound of a buzzer above my head, much louder than my usual alarm clock. My eyes slowly open, struggling to adjust to the light as I sit up in what appears to be a cot. Something feels off. As my vision clears, I realize I am staring at a dirty concrete floor, littered with cracks and dirt. Beside me is a grimy mattress on a metal frame, emitting a foul odor of body odor and urine. Confusion sets in as I wonder where I am.\n\nLooking to my side, I see a large tattooed man in an orange jumpsuit sitting on a cot across from me, clutching a boot with a look of terror on his face. Attempting to speak, my voice comes out hoarse, only managing a grunt before a fit of coughing overtakes me. The man recoils, moving away from me in fear, clutching his boot tightly.\n\nStruggling to clear my throat, I finally manage to ask him where we are, but his response is filled with fear and hostility. He accuses me of being a monster, claiming that I have done terrible things. I try to explain that I have no idea what he is talking about, recounting my last memory of being at a bar with friends before blacking out.\n\nRealization dawns on me as I notice the bars blocking the entrance to the cell we are in. I am in jail. Panic sets in as I try to make sense of how I ended up here. The guard interrupts our conversation, ordering us to get ready for breakfast. As we are led out of the cell, I notice the orange jumpsuit I am wearing, along with an ID patch on my chest.\n\nWalking through the corridors with other inmates, I try to ask one of them about the place we are in, only to be met with anger and warnings to stay quiet. The atmosphere grows tense as the inmates around me react with fear and hostility, pushing and shoving to get away from me.\n\nChaos erupts as the inmates start to panic, reacting violently to my presence. Guards intervene, using force to control the situation. Amidst the commotion, the chain linking me to the other inmates breaks, giving me a moment to escape. However, I am quickly restrained by the guard, who delivers a jolt of electricity, causing me to lose consciousness.\n\nWhen I regain awareness, I find myself in a dark alley, facing a figure pointing a gun at me. A tense exchange unfolds as accusations and pleas are exchanged, culminating in a decision that leads to a catastrophic outcome. The ground shakes, a deafening blast reverberates, and darkness envelops me as the world fades away."}, "t1_chwma98": {"original_text": "The scent of antiseptics wasn't an easy one to get used to. It was the trademark smell of the hospital, that kind of smell that makes people feel uneasy for reasons that aren't fully realized; perhaps a fear of the hospital and the sharp objects it holds, or maybe just the overall sense of not exactly being in control of a situation. When you're t-boned by an eighteen wheeler and have your ribcage crushed, there really isn't much control you can have. Joel eyed the mess of crusted blood and broken bones that was the body of the young Julie Crones, grimacing as he took notes of her skin coloration. It was January 1st; the cold weather that came with the day made the already cold morgue feel even more unnaturally cold than it normally was. Joel was still hungover from the New Years party his friends had through the night before, and judging from Julie's charts, she'd probably be hungover too if she had still been breathing at the moment. The large double doors to the morgue burst open, one door clanging into a wall and the other into an unused gurney. Joel turned to look at who the noisemaker was only to see a young woman with blonde hair rush forward. She was wearing what looked like a black tunic, black jeans, and plain white tennis shoes. The antiseptic smell that normally permeated the morgue vanished as she ran towards Joel and Julie. \"Hey you're not- The woman pushed Joel to the side with a firm hand to his sternum, wedging herself between him and the deceased Julie. Joel gasped for a breath as he stumbled away from the woman; it had felt like he had been shoulder charged by a hockey player. He raised a hand to his chest and froze. He couldn't feel his own heartbeat. The room faded and he became lightheaded, but after a few seconds, his heart came back to life, first with an erratic and slow heartbeat, but then finally getting back into rhythm like a young child who finally got the hang of riding a bicycle without the training wheels. He stood there, wondering if he should find a doctor or if he should deal with this woman who had the touch of death, but the thoughts were soon thrown aside. The strange blonde woman was attempting to resuscitate the long dead and cold Julie. She had her hands pressed into Julie's sternum, causing Julie's ribcage to audibly crack with each press. \"Hey,\" Joel said lightly, \"she's already dead, she's been dead for awhile.\" The blonde woman ignored Joel and instead resorted to mouth to mouth. \"Whoa whoa whoa, that's not necessary, she's gone!\" Joel yelled, stepping forward and reaching out with a tentative hand. Before he touched the crazed woman, she turned to him, tears streaming down her face. \"No,\" she cried, \"I couldn't save her. I can't save anyone at all! Why can't I save anyone?\" Well, I can think of a few good reasons, one being that you were a couple hours too late, Joel thought. The woman reached forward to Joel with a scrawny pale hand, causing him to instinctively take a step back. \"No, you're okay, you don't need to be rescued,\" the woman spoke softly. She turned to get another look at Julie, then left back out through the morgue double doors, leaving the two alone once again. After finally regaining his composure, Joel decided to go tell security abut the crazed blonde woman, but not before noticing that Julie's complexion had grown more pale.", "rewritten_text": "The hospital's trademark scent of antiseptics was not easy to acclimate to. It evoked an unease in people, the reasons for which were not entirely clear. Perhaps it was a fear of hospitals and the sharp tools they housed, or simply the feeling of lacking control in a situation. When faced with a situation like being hit by an eighteen-wheeler and having one's ribcage crushed, control was a luxury one could not afford. Joel observed the grim sight of young Julie Crones, her body a mess of crusted blood and broken bones, while noting her skin coloration. It was January 1st, and the cold weather outside made the morgue feel even colder than usual. Joel, still recovering from a New Year's party hangover, speculated that Julie would likely have been hungover too if she were still alive. \n\nSuddenly, the morgue's large double doors swung open with a loud clang, revealing a young woman with blonde hair rushing in. Dressed in a black tunic, black jeans, and white tennis shoes, she brought with her a sense of urgency that dispelled the usual antiseptic smell. Ignoring Joel's presence, the woman pushed him aside with a strong hand to his sternum, positioning herself between him and the deceased Julie. Startled, Joel stumbled back, feeling as though he had been tackled by a hockey player. As he tried to catch his breath, he realized his heartbeat had momentarily disappeared, leaving him lightheaded. However, it soon returned, irregular at first but gradually stabilizing.\n\nAs Joel debated whether to seek medical help or confront the mysterious woman, his attention was drawn back to her. She was attempting to resuscitate Julie, pressing down on her sternum with forceful motions that audibly cracked her ribcage. Despite Joel's protests that Julie was already deceased, the woman persisted, even resorting to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Overwhelmed with emotion, she lamented her inability to save anyone, prompting Joel to think she was too late to help Julie.\n\nThe woman, in tears, reached out to Joel, who instinctively recoiled. Assuring him that he did not need saving, she turned back to Julie before abruptly leaving through the morgue doors, leaving Joel alone with the lifeless body once more. Collecting himself, Joel decided to inform security about the woman's erratic behavior, noticing in passing that Julie's complexion had grown even paler."}, "t1_egdl903": {"original_text": "I had a good feeling about this. There weren't many opportunities in life to become someone else, but this was one of them. My friends were already online, waiting for me. Georgie had rolled a Dragonkin knight and was already cleaving her way through the rambling forces of demon spawn with a battleaxe almost as big as she was. It was the perfect fit for the girl with the big personality and even bigger voice. By contrast, Ed, the quiet one of our group, had rolled an Elven monk, at peace with himself, he healed Georgie through her furious antics while defending himself with an intricately engraved staff. Danny, of course, had rolled a human rogue. He was already setting traps for the opposing faction and had angered an entire village by stealing chicken eggs. Why he wanted the eggs is anyone's guess. Now, finally I was home from work and ready to reveal my character. There was no going back after I hit the character creation button. The buffering icon rotated as it randomly generated my character for life. Georgie and Danny were joking over Discord about what I was going to get but I didn't rise to it, I was confident in this. I was going to be something that dealt a lot of damage, maybe a mage or a hunter, that would complete our dungeon group and be the perfect fit for me. At least, that's what I thought right up until the screen changed. It must be a bug, a glitch of some kind, I don't believe what I see on the screen. My friends are asking me what I got but I can't bring myself to answer. How do I explain this? The whole UI had changed, where the animated battlefields of Ameryth had been glowing in the background, there was nothing but darkness. In the centre, where there should be his randomly generated character dancing was a single message box. I look for a little X in the corner or a back button but I'm not offered one. All the box says is \"Welcome, Chosen One, to your world: Ameryth.\"Maybe they've just changed the welcome message, it did seem to be a bit early for a patch but perhaps I'd missed it while I was at work. I was about to ask my friends if there'd been a hotfix already when the message changed.\"Should a deity tell it's subjects that it is their god?\" I stare at the words, a deity? That wasn't on the list of races or classes. It must be a bug. The words faded and revealed new ones again. \"You are the Game Master, you are god.\" A Game Master? How could I be a Game Master? What did that even mean? The words shifted and changed, they were my only hope in this dark new world. \"While you may not walk the surface of Ameryth, you are it's guiding light. You are god.\" The message box vanished leaving the screen black. My heart hammered in my chest. If I couldn't play the game what was the point? Slowly a light bloomed across the screen, it revealed the world of Ameryth turning below me. Next the tool bars appeared along either side of my screen. I barely had chance to look at what the buttons did before a message icon flashed in the top right hand corner. I hovered my mouse over it. \"Prayer\" was all it said. I clicked on it to open the message box. \"Dear GM, god of Ameryth. I pray for your mercy, for I am trapped behind an NPC in the back of a barn and cannot get out. Please have mercy and free me.\" I could free the poor soul or I could leave him trapped there for all eternity. As I surveyed my array of omnipotent tools I realised that it was completely within my power to teleport them into an end game dungeon where the level 3 goblin shaman would die over and over again to the wrath of the level 100 demon lord. Alternatively, I could move him to the temple of Shiraan where he would be doted upon forever by the priestesses who lived there. My friends were losing patience as they waited for me to reply to them in the Discord channel. Does a god reveal to its subjects that it is a god? Yes. Yes it does. \"I am god\" I type. They laugh until they realise that I'm not joking. They don't believe me though until I force them all to dance, Georgie even tried logging out and back in again but when her character didn't stop dancing they realised the truth. I had never been the powerful one before but now I was their god. I was the god of the whole of Ameryth. The prayers were already pouring in as my subjects discovered unfortunate bugs and glitches in the new world. My mouse hovered over the tools at my disposal as I considered my options. The question was, would I be a benevolent or a malicious god?", "rewritten_text": "I had a strong intuition about this moment. Opportunities to transform oneself were rare in life, but this was one of them. My friends were already online, eagerly awaiting my arrival. Georgie had chosen a Dragonkin knight and was fearlessly battling her way through hordes of demon spawn with a battleaxe almost as large as herself. It suited her bold personality and commanding voice perfectly. On the other hand, Ed, the quiet member of our group, had selected an Elven monk. Serene and composed, he supported Georgie with healing abilities while defending himself with an intricately engraved staff. Meanwhile, Danny had opted for a human rogue, setting traps for enemies and causing chaos by stealing chicken eggs from a village. As I returned home from work, it was finally my turn to reveal my character. Pressing the character creation button, I knew there was no turning back. The loading icon spun as my character was randomly generated for me. Georgie and Danny teased me over Discord about what I might get, but I remained confident. I envisioned myself as a powerful damage dealer, perhaps a mage or a hunter, to complement our dungeon group perfectly. However, my expectations were shattered when the screen transformed. It seemed like a bug or glitch at first, as I couldn't believe what I saw. My friends eagerly inquired about my character, but I was at a loss for words. The user interface had completely changed, displaying a single message box in place of the usual character display. The message read, \"Welcome, Chosen One, to your world: Ameryth.\" I speculated that it might be a new welcome message, but my confusion deepened as the message evolved. It now proclaimed, \"Should a deity tell its subjects that it is their god?\" A deity? That concept was not part of the game's races or classes. The message then shifted to reveal, \"You are the Game Master, you are god.\" I was bewildered by this revelation. What did it mean to be a Game Master? The message continued, offering me guidance in this unfamiliar world. \"While you may not walk the surface of Ameryth, you are its guiding light. You are god.\" The message box disappeared, leaving me in a state of shock. If I couldn't play the game, what was the purpose of being there? Gradually, light illuminated the screen, unveiling the world of Ameryth below. Toolbars appeared on either side of the screen, and a message icon flashed in the corner, labeled \"Prayer.\" I hesitated before opening the message box, which contained a plea from a trapped player seeking my help. I realized that I held the power to either free them or leave them stranded. As I contemplated my omnipotent abilities, I understood that I could shape the fate of this world. My friends grew impatient as they awaited my response in the Discord channel. Deciding to reveal my newfound status, I typed, \"I am god.\" Initially met with laughter, their skepticism faded when I demonstrated my powers by making their characters dance uncontrollably. I had never wielded such authority before, but now I was their god, overseeing the realm of Ameryth. Prayers flooded in as my subjects encountered glitches and issues in the new world. With a multitude of tools at my disposal, I pondered whether to be a benevolent or malevolent deity. The question lingered: would I use my powers for good or ill?"}, "t1_dfo5mch": {"original_text": "I looked at myself in the mirror. The look was forlorn, probably, but I couldn't really tell what my face would have told an observer. A face with 75 years of wear and tear built into the skin and eyes is somewhat opaque. The gaps between forlorn, melancholy, amused, and confused facial expressions on a younger person are rather clear. Recognizing those gaps is normally a matter of noticing when responsive, youthful skin twitches after a hidden tug from a tendon or muscle buried under layers of facial tissue. This grows to be impossible as gravity robs our skin of elasticity. Age. Cunt. My eyes drifted to my tie. I am the only septuagenarian graduating this semester. I am, as far as I know, the only septuagenarian who has graduated from any school in my state since... Since... Well, funny how age works. They told me earlier this week. Could have been the 1980s or the 1880s, for all I know. I don't remember. My hands will themselves to stroke my chin and run themselves through my hair, seek a pocket with some index cards. The date is on the third index card. I know this because I made sure to include that observation while writing my speech. I am not really giving a speech. But I wrote these cards out just in case. They don't allow septuagenarians to bumble onto stage to give speeches to little teeny boppers fresh on the job market for the first time. Not unless they are the university president, or an astronaut. But. I wrote these cards out just in case. I mean, I have a lot to say. I have been around the block. I have been in hot wars and cold wars and economic busts and booms. Maybe someone will ask. My hand flicks a corner of an index card. Not one of the men I knew in 1961 would have been able to graduate college. None of them survived the war. I turned to the third card. 1992. I slip the cards, in order, back in my pocket. My sister is taking me to graduation because my children are gone now. The bell rings. That will be her. I open the door, and she pushes past me with a box. \"Bleach,\" she said. \"I... What?\" \"Bleach. I washed your graduation robe for you because it's a rental and who knows where they have been or whether they were washed at all when they were returned or what and I know you have sensitive skin so I just washed it.\" She took a deep breath. \"But I made a mistake. I didn't mean to.\" My face microscopically transitioned from forlorn to amused as she pulled a bleach-pink robe. I think back to my platoon in Vietnam, and the education levels of my fellow soldiers. Third grade. Sixth grade. High school. \"Yep. Seems right. Let's do it.\"", "rewritten_text": "As I gazed at my reflection in the mirror, a sense of forlornness washed over me, though deciphering the exact message my face conveyed proved challenging. The years had etched their marks on my skin and eyes, rendering them somewhat inscrutable. Unlike the clear distinctions between expressions of sorrow, amusement, and confusion on a younger visage, the nuances on my weathered face were blurred. The telltale signs of youth, such as subtle twitches caused by underlying muscles, had long since faded, lost to the relentless pull of gravity and the passage of time.\n\nMy attention shifted to my tie, a subtle reminder of my unique position as the sole septuagenarian set to graduate this semester. To my knowledge, I would be the first septuagenarian in my state to achieve this milestone in recent memory. The concept of time seemed elusive, its grasp slipping through my fingers like sand. The specifics eluded me, whether it was the 1980s or the 1880s when I received the news. My hands instinctively moved to my chin and hair, seeking solace in the familiar routine of touching the index cards tucked away in my pocket.\n\nThe third card held the key\u2014the date I had meticulously noted down for my speech, a speech I might never deliver. While septuagenarians like myself were not typically granted the opportunity to address the graduating class, I had prepared the cards just in case. The wealth of experiences and wisdom accumulated over the years begged to be shared, a testament to a life lived through wars, economic upheavals, and societal shifts.\n\nAs I pondered the significance of the date on the index card, memories of comrades lost in conflicts past flooded my mind. Their absence a stark reminder of the sacrifices made and the paths left untaken. With a sense of resolve, I returned the cards to their rightful place, ready to face the next chapter.\n\nThe sound of the bell signaled the arrival of my sister, my steadfast companion for this momentous occasion. Her unexpected gift of a freshly washed graduation robe, tinged with a hint of bleach, brought a flicker of amusement to my face. The contrast between the pristine garment and the memories of my time in Vietnam, surrounded by soldiers with varying levels of education, struck a chord within me.\n\nWith a nod of affirmation, I embraced the symbolism of the bleach-pink robe, a reminder of the unexpected twists and turns life had taken. As my sister and I prepared to embark on this new journey together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the moments that had led me to this point. \"Yes,\" I whispered to myself, \"let's do it.\""}, "t1_kfxdzxr": {"original_text": "People, as a general rule, think they\u2019re the center of the universe.

She wrinkles her freckled nose in distaste. \"That\u2019s a cinnamon.\"\n\n\"Synonym,\" I correct her. \"Why are you eating ladybugs?\" she persists. \"Well, I'm not. This isn\u2019t a ladybug, although it does bear a striking resemblance. It's a beetle masquerading as a ladybug to reap the benefits of its appearance while devouring everything it shouldn't,\" I explain. I drain the life force from the bugs, causing them to fall from my hand and drift down to the soil. It's a minor energy boost; insects are only truly worthwhile when found in a colony. However, I couldn't ignore the imposter I spotted out of the corner of my eye. After all, ladybugs need all the help they can get in this harsh world.\n\n\"I feel bad for them,\" the girl laments, pouting at the motionless bodies. \"Don't,\" I dismiss, brushing most of the soil off my hands. \"They're troublesome little\u2014\" Before I can finish, the governor's steward comes rushing down the main road, his bulky form wobbling with haste. Once he reaches me, panting and flushed, he blurts out, \"Miss Perkins is dead!\" The old woman from the apothecary. \"Oh. Good.\" Oh, that's not the appropriate response. The steward grows more agitated, his voice trembling. \"She was murdered!\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't do it,\" I retort. \"What? No, no, of course you didn't,\" he stammers. \"Oh. That's a change. Usually, people assume I'm the culprit,\" I remark. The steward continues, \"No, the practitioner, the man, he did it right in front of everyone! At the market!\" \"I suppose that would cause a stir,\" I acknowledge. \"He's like you!\" the steward exclaims. \"Charming and effervescent?\" I jest. \"No, I\u2014Mistress, you're not taking this seriously at all! He's a Life Force practitioner.\"\n\nThe steward's demeanor shifts, his tone grave. He understands the gravity of the situation and what he's asking of me. To him, it's a death sentence\u2014a bug eater pitted against a human devourer. The other mages won't be of much help; we are feared for a valid reason. I sigh and glance down at the pale-faced little girl, her eyes wide with fear. I have grown fond of this town, and the prospect of finding a new place where people don't flee in terror seems daunting. With the old woman gone, the town will practically be paradise. No more stones hurled at me as I pass by the shop. I might as well step in and save the day. I gesture vaguely for the steward to lead the way."}, "t1_elowqc4": {"original_text": "$7.27 After finally working out the fabrics of our universe, things as we know it rapidly changed: Space was no obstacle anymore, we could fold it like it was nothing, making stuff like teleportation or boxes with infinite space within easy peasy, whilst time could be manipulated just as easily.

Head injuries like mine can have complications, she\u2019s told me. It\u2019s a good idea to write things down because memories can be fleeting sometimes. &#x200B; I don\u2019t remember the accident itself. I awoke in this bed. My wife was asleep holding my hand, and there was a drip in my arm. \u201cGet Well Soon\u201d cards festooned a cabinet in my line of sight, but the bandages wound too tightly around my head covered my left eye and prevented me from seeing any more. &#x200B; A dull thumping headache threatened to make me sick when I thought about moving, and I fell asleep again, dreaming of ambulance sirens chasing me through a thousand rooms. &#x200B; It was dark outside when I awoke again, to the sound of murmured voices. I recognised my wife\u2019s voice. It always made me smile, and I smiled then. My throat was dry, and I needed water. The headache was gone, but a tightness remained, like a belt straining against too much food. I coughed painfully, and swallowed uncomfortably, and the voices stopped. &#x200B; \u201cHe\u2019s awake now,\u201d said a voice I later learned was Dr Elizabeth Bernstein, a specialist in cranial reconstruction. \u201cCan you hear us, Jonas?\u201d &#x200B; I tried to ask for water, and my croaking must have been recognisable enough, because my wife, standing next to the doctor, smiled that smile which had made me fall in love with her and poured me some water from a jug beside the hospital bed. &#x200B; She held my hand and looked into my eyes. With a quaver in her normally calm voice she said, \u201cThere was a big gas leak at the old power plant. No-one knows what ignited it, but the explosion took out the monorail just before the train got there. There were so many hurt. So many. Even before I knew it was the train you take, I was horrified.\u201d &#x200B; \u201cAnd you were hurt so bad\u201d, a tear trickled down her cheek. \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you, but you\u2019re too hard-headed to die on me.\u201d &#x200B; Dr Bernstein spoke then, \u201cYou have recovered remarkably well, Mr Collins. Blunt force trauma to the left side of your head was the most serious injury, but you had burns on both legs and multiple scratches and bruises down your right side from broken glass. It looks like someone might have dragged you out of the wreckage, although we don\u2019t know that for sure. You were found by paramedics a little way from the carriage closest the rear of the train.\u201d &#x200B; I always sit there. Fourth carriage. Back seat on the left. Behind the guy with the square glasses and next to the old lady with the knitting. Others come and go, but those two always have the same seats, day after day. The WiFi is best there, so there are lots of youngsters in that carriage in the morning, and busy looking business types in the evening, but they get on the stop after me, so I normally get my spot on the 815 in the morning and the 1715 at night. It takes me from work to home in 40 minutes. &#x200B; See, I like routine because my memory is so bad. Habits get me through life. As my dad used to say \u201cDon\u2019t have to remember to do it if you do it habitually.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he ever forgot anything in his life, though. Leastways, he always remembered when he promised me we could go for ice cream. &#x200B; They were both looking at me from the end of the bed. I realised I hadn\u2019t replied, and I must be a bit disoriented because I thought my wife was by my side. &#x200B; \u201cThanks Doc\u201d, I managed to say. \u201cAre there likely to be any ongoing problems? I feel kinda weird. And my eye?\u201d &#x200B; She looked concerned at my admission, and looked at the clipboard she had picked up without me noticing. \u201cHead injuries are always risky,\u201d she replied. \u201cand because of the extensive damage, we\u2019re going to have to keep you here for some considerable time. Your eye had glass in it, which we able to remove completely, and the eye itself is healing nicely, but we\u2019ll have to wait a while before we know for sure whether you have any visual problems. Don\u2019t try to use it before it\u2019s completely healed.\u201d &#x200B; \u201cAs for the feeling weird. Can you explain what you mean?\u201d &#x200B; I struggled to put words to the feeling, but my attempts to articulate the constricted feeling I had experienced left even me unsatisfied. &#x200B; \u201cI\u2019d like you to keep a diary of how you\u2019re feeling, if you don\u2019t mind. Let me know the highlights, and if you have anything more concrete which concerns you, note it down in as many ways as you can so that we can address it.\u201d She smiled brightly, in the way that people do when they are unsure, but anxious to radiate calm. \u201cIn the meantime, drink lots of water, get lots of sleep, and don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d &#x200B; I nodded, realising that simply being awake had exhausted me, and I fell asleep a few minutes later, to the muffled sounds of a hospital at night. &#x200B; Day Two ====== I have been unconscious for the best part of a month, it turns out. My work have put me on the long-term sick list, and aren\u2019t expecting me back any time soon. &#x200B; I spent the morning reminiscing with my wife, reminding her of the time we visited Paris. How we had sat under a hill just outside the city, a tree at our back, looking down on houses below, and a baby goat from a nearby farm decided we were the most interesting thing in the world and was determined to get in our picnic basket. Her laughs as I described the antics in great detail warmed my heart, and her delight at long forgotten memories were a balm to my growing unease. &#x200B; You see, I remember the picnic incident as plain as if it had happened moments ago, even though I\u2019ve not thought about it in years. It\u2019s like a movie playing in my head that I can instantly jump to any part of. &#x200B; I\u2019ve always been able to remember anything I saw on a screen, which makes my job as a software developer a whole lot easier, but I\u2019ve always struggled to remember the more mundane parts of life. Did I lock the front door, did I check the windows before bed, did I make sure the oven is off? &#x200B; I mentioned remembering the picnic incident to Dr Bernstein, and she was pleased that I could remember things from long term memory. Apparently that was a concern for some of the surgeons. That worried me more, but she calmed my fears, and assured me that I was in good hands, and everything had gone well during the month I had been unconscious. &#x200B; The afternoon was spent watching reruns of old shows on the tiny hospital TV. I fell asleep a dozen times, and each time I woke, a different show was on. &#x200B; Day Three ======== I had a horrendous dream last night. It was strangely vivid, so I am writing it down before I forget it. &#x200B; I dreamt I had awoken in a strange bed to a screaming burning coming from the side of my head. Alarms were going off, and smoke filled the air. It felt so real, and still does. I\u2019m shaking as I write this. &#x200B; In my mind\u2019s eye, I can still see blood and bodies and death and destruction. I was blinded by the smoke, and I blinked watery eyes to work out what I was seeing. The rebel army was attacking, which made perfect sense to my dream self, but is obviously nonsense now. Blood dripped from my beard (I\u2019m clean shaven), and splashed onto a map of a place I\u2019ve never seen before. I looked at my arm, and a holographic image of several dozen soldiers who wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a science fiction movie took shape. &#x200B; I knew there was no way out, and a calm took me. I lifted a small plain glass plate with rounded edges from a pocket on my jacket, and stared at the very recognisable beardless man with a bandage round his head and covering one eye. &#x200B; \u201cYour turn, Jonas\u201d, said my dream self, and I woke up for the second time in as many minutes. &#x200B; I never remember dreams, except maybe that weird one about a cartoon beach ball changing into a shark, but this one stayed in my mind all day. &#x200B; .. &#x200B; I\u2019ve replayed the two minute dream in my head over and over, and it makes just as little sense now as it did when I wrote it down this morning. &#x200B; I had two working eyes in the dream, and I was Captain James Tollinson, third in command on the Ceti Expeditionary Force. I smiled at the thought. I am not adventurous, and I don\u2019t like telling people what to do. I\u2019m easy going, and prefer to let others get their way. &#x200B; Perhaps my subconscious was try to help with my last performance review at work. &#x200B; \u201cYou\u2019re work is great\u201d, my boss had written in his truly abysmal grammatical style, \u201cbut you need to be more forcefull. You have good ideas, but you always let other people do it there way.\u201d &#x200B; Grammar aside, he had a point. I hated being the one to decide anything, and I definitely prefer the quiet life, even if I have to work a little harder because of it. &#x200B; (to be continued)", "rewritten_text": "Day One\n\nThe doctor advised me to keep a diary to aid in memory retention, especially given the potential complications associated with head injuries like mine. Writing things down is crucial as memories can be fleeting at times.\n\nI have no recollection of the accident itself. I woke up in a hospital bed with my wife by my side, asleep and holding my hand.

Although the headache had subsided, a lingering tightness persisted, akin to a belt straining against overeating. As I coughed and swallowed uncomfortably, the voices ceased.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Bernstein, a specialist in cranial reconstruction, identified herself and confirmed my awakening. She inquired if I could hear them, to which I attempted to ask for water. Recognizing my need, my wife, standing beside the doctor, poured me a glass.\n\nShe held my hand and gazed into my eyes, her voice trembling slightly as she recounted the details of the accident involving a gas leak at an old power plant. The explosion had caused significant harm to many individuals, including myself. Overwhelmed with emotion, she expressed relief at my survival, remarking on my resilience.\n\nDr. Bernstein then provided a detailed account of my injuries, highlighting the severity of blunt force trauma to the left side of my head, along with burns on both legs and various scratches and bruises. She mentioned the possibility of someone rescuing me from the wreckage, although the specifics remained unclear.\n\nI typically sat in the fourth carriage, back seat on the left, during my daily commute.

Spending the morning reminiscing with my wife about past experiences brought warmth to my heart, despite a growing sense of unease.\n\nRecalling a specific memory from our time in Paris, I marveled at my ability to vividly remember certain events, contrasting with my struggles to retain everyday details. This contrast intrigued Dr. Bernstein, who reassured me about the significance of my long-term memory capabilities.\n\nThe afternoon was spent watching old TV shows on the hospital's small screen, punctuated by brief moments of slumber.\n\nDay Three\n\nA vivid and unsettling dream plagued my sleep last night, prompting me to document it before it faded from memory. The dream depicted a chaotic scenario where I awoke in a strange setting, engulfed in flames and surrounded by alarming imagery.\n\nThe dream's intensity lingered throughout the day, as I grappled with its nonsensical yet haunting details.

If she had arrived at a bank and recognized Wraith, the world's most powerful and undefeated supervillain as her own father... well, I feel that would possibly kill her like it did her mother. I guess I did prefer the quiet life of being an investor, though. I could sit around and read all day, work out even though it didn't really help and all... I learned carpentry as a hobby. Although, my retirement from the world of super-powered crime came to an end when that one report came on the news. 'Breaking news,' the anchorwoman said. 'Terrorists have seized the New York offices of Atlantic City News and have placed a nuclear weapon inside the building.' I looked up from my building in shock. That was where Julie worked in her civilian identity! 'What...?' I asked in shock. 'The National Guard tried to evacuate civilians away from the building before several trucks were destroyed by bombs,' the anchorwoman said. 'The terrorist leader, known only as Tecno, has declared that he will detonate if he believes that anyone is being evacuated. Other demands have not yet been made but-' I switched over to ACN's channel and saw reporters and other staff being hurried into the main studio. And that was when I saw Julie sitting in the room. She was tied to the bomb. 'We will make this clear,' one robotic minion said. 'Ten billion dollars deposited into the account shown on-screen or the bomb will detonate. You have twenty-four hours to comply.' The President won't allow anyone to pay, he was rather anal about the \"We don't negotiate with terrorists\" nonsense. Although his predecessor did comply when I lifted the White House and threatened to drop him and his family onto the ground. But I knew what buttons to press. What Tecno was doing... far too excessive to be worth it. And yet, I felt a great fire within my chest. I set my book down, pulled out my phone and made my way to the garage while calling a number. 'Howard?' the woman said on the other end. 'I haven't heard from you in years! What's this about?' 'You saw the news, right?' I asked as I climbed in and began driving down the road. 'Tecno's little stunt?' 'Newer tech-based villain,' she declared. 'He's declared Persona Non Grata by the guild because of his... eccentricities.' 'Full report,' I barked to her. 'Name, history. Current location.' 'You retired,' she answered. 'You know the rules - full fees.' 'Well, how about this?' I said in a cheerful choice. 'Do you remember how you said that yu wouldn't like to see me declare vengeance on anyone? How I kept everything professional? This is personal. I will declare war on the guild.' 'Fuck, that was Julie,' she groaned. 'Well, I guess it's true why you retired? She's Fantasia?' 'One word,' I said to her, 'and you will be screaming for weeks as I kill you.' 'He's based out of his basement in Silicon Valley,' she said. 'And I'll have his network breached in fifteen minutes.' 'Reports are coming through that the hostages have been freed,' the anchor said as he lit the cigar. 'It is unconfirmed what has happened, but the various droids have shut down and the bomb is now considered unarmed. Various heroes are heading inside to ensure that everyone is out before the bomb is-' I destroyed the screen with a laser blast while flexing my muscular arm underneath the rubber and spandex. After all these years, if felt like such a relief to be back in the costume. 'See?' I asked him. 'That wasn't so hard, was it?' The man in the mechanical wheelchair was shaking rather violently before I walked to the window and glanced outside. 'Quite a few kids in this neighborhood,' I commented. 'What was it that cost you the use of your legs? Medea caught you trying to groom her kids? I'm surprised you're still alive after that. You're meant to tell your neighbors about something like that, right?' 'L-look, man,' he tried to plead. 'I ain't done nothing for you!' 'Oh, that is absolutely wrong,' I said calmly while returning to him, calmly throwing him - and his wheelchair - over to the nearby wall. 'My kid is working in New York. Sweet kid as well. Don't know how a bastard like myself created something so pure.' I picked up a nearby rope and then walked over to Adrian, throwing his head down between his knees so I could tie his hands together. Then I threw his head back up. I tied two ends to his ankles then hung him upside down from two wooden beams. 'W-what are you d-doing?!' he screamed. 'Ma! Ma, where are you?!' 'Just... just hold that thought for one moment,' I said as I pulled something out of the box, extended it, fixed a bolt and... 'What the shit?!' Tecno screamed. 'A-a chainsaw?!' 'Circular sawblade, actually,' I recited as I made sure it was working. That was before I got a text from Julie. I'm safe, but I need to talk to the police. I'll call you later, she wrong. I've paid for a plane ticket, I wrote back. Come back home for a week. 'Do you want to know an old execution technique I read about once?' I said to him while putting the phone away. 'The condemned was hung upside down while two men used a saw to cut him in half. You see, he was upside down so that the blood would still go to his brain, meaning he'd die slower. I just modernized it a little.' I squatted down to his level. 'Thanks for soundproofing the house,' I said to him. 'No-one will ever know what will happen to you until after you're dead. And guess how long it will take before this even begins to kill you?' 'T-twenty four hours?' he guessed. '...More like half an hour,' I said to him. Then I stood up, walking towards the stairs. 'Wait!' he screamed. 'My ma can't find me like this! It'll kill her. Please!' 'Oh, don't worry,' I said while giving him a wicked smile. Then he started struggling. 'Don't you hurt my ma!' he yelled.

They never evolved with the luxury of self-farming fungi or a planet-wide edible plant. They were forced to scavenge. They were forced to adapt. They were forced to make do with what they had. Every race has a fundamental sense of taste, but they only evolved them in order to detect parasites hidden within their food. Humans, on the other hand, never had one consistent food source. They were forced to develop taste to identify if something was even edible, let alone tainted. Because of that, more than any other species, they developed a sort of taste-spectrum. They can identify acids and alkalis in foods, as well as identify foods high in glucose, salt, protein, carbohydrates, and so much more - and they can even tell the difference! And because their food sources were so varied and undependable, they learnt to mix different food sources into one unified meal - a \"dish\". From the day they formed their first civilisations up until today, food has remained a cornerstone of each culture. To them, ingestion was something to enjoy and relish, not just something your body compelled you to do. They ate to celebrate. They ate to socialise. They ate to feel better. Because of this, they developed something entirely unique to their kind - cooking. Cooking became an artform among them. How can you combine the various textures and flavours into the most succulent and enjoyable form possible? How can you present your food in such a way that it most stimulates the anticipation to eat? How can you optimise your food to be the most nutritious, yet still make it appealing to that specialised and refined taste? Before humans came into contact with the rest of us, a garton would eat when she walked past a fungus-tree, at which point her body would compel itself to claw a crumbly chunk out of it. She would ingest it as quickly as possible so she could get on with things. Now, a garton eats when she sits down at a mighty table, rife and beaming with anticipation. She will be served her course, and she will dig into it with no reservation or hesitation. As it passed her taste buds, she will feel a tranquil, vivifying appeasement and enjoyment surge through her entire body like a flood through a dry canyon. In those moments, she will become acquainted with a side of her that she has never met before; a passionate, artful soul that can supernaturally pick apart every bit of what makes the dish so stimulating to the senses and so delightful to the soul. She will ingest slowly, nourishing every mouthful as if they were the last things she will ever experience. She finish the meal satisfied in mind and body, and will return with glee to her daily duties. Fungus-trees, aibon-fruit, and tamarils have nothing upon even the worst of a human's work. Even better?

There were six vehicles in the convoy, four of them troop carriers. The other two were modified pickup trucks with a barely attatched crew served weapon on the back of each. 50 men in all. Strong security for a jungle warlord, but nothing Roland's men couldn't handle. They say that in moments of intense focus, time slows for the individual. True, or not, it felt that way for Captain Roland. A single bead of sweat, having escaped Roland's brow for sake of the hot Congolese sun, took hours to roll down his cheek. The rocket of the M72 LAW seemingly glided towards the lead pickup in the convoy, sunlight reflecting off the rocket's metal casing as it gracefully spun through the air. The impact was beautiful.

Grenades and automatic rifle fire poured into the road, fire concentrated on the pickups. \"Technicals down, adjust fire!\" Roland shouted. By that time the men in the trucks, Mebutu's much needed reenforcements, began pouring out of the trucks and returning fire, vying for whatever cover they could behind their vehicles. \"Your turn, VanOwen!\" commanded Roland. Sergeant VanOwen, was one twisted individual. An orphan from birth, he grew into a pyromania phase and never grew out of it. Common advice is to find what you love doing and figure out how to make money doing it. Demolition became VanOwen's business, and business was good in the Congo. Sergeant VanOwen grinned at the Captain's order, and pounded his hands into the trigger device for the Claymore Mines planted alongside the road. A series of explosions harkened thousands of steel ball bearings that hurtled towards the Bantu troops. Steel ripped through flesh, and cloth, and the thin walls of the troop carriers. Ambushes are quick, and this one was over in less than two minutes. The combined might of rockets, anti-personnel mines, and automatic fire had made short work on the unexpecting Bantu troops. Roland and his men cleared the objective and disabled the Bantu vehicles. \"Easy paycheck, eh Van'?\" Roland said. \"Ja,\" said VanOwen, \"Ja it was.\" \"Alright boys,\" Roland said. \"Let's get a move on, we don't want to be anywhere near here when their friends find them.\" VanOwen fingered the letter in his pocket and thought of the late night meeting with Agent Scott. Roland was a friend, but the money was too good. \"Ja, let us go.\" he said.", "rewritten_text": "The jungle was enveloped in an eerie stillness. The breeze had ceased, the birds were silent, and even death itself seemed to hold its breath. Captain Roland, with deliberate precision, pressed the button on the radio, breaking the silence. \"LP/OP has confirmed visual. We're all set. Wait until the rear vehicle moves into the killzone. Technicals first.\" Quiet confirmations and acknowledgements came through his earpiece. His men were ready. Roland caressed the grip of his Thompson Gun with his thumb, checked his watch, and grinned. They were right on schedule. The sound of approaching trucks became audible before they came into view.

I washed my new Charger, like I do every Sunday after church. We have a nice family brunch, and the boy spent all his money from his paper route on a new X-Box game. I was trying to teach me son a lesson on budgeting and the value of money. What a fuckin' waste. He was broke. My daughter ran off to pick-up her new boyfriend. What kind of man doesn't have his own car? `Jesus fuckin' Christ I don't know how kids these days will ever make it. Oh, and it rained right as I was pulling the car into the garage. Yep, one of those days. I just knew there was something up with this... boy. It was probably two, no two thirty. I was just starting to relax in my chair. Remote in one hand, beer in the other, and Fox New on the boobtube. Better yet, Trump was on. Ohhhh yeahhh. That's when the door rang. I shoulda known somthin' was up. I heard my wife talking to someone in low tones. I couldn't make out what she was saying so I got up and went to the kitchen to get a better earshot. The door opened and closed. Awwwww motha fuckaaaaa. Y'all ain't keeping secrets in MY house. So I went to the bedroom and put some pants on. What? It's my fuckin' house I go around buck naked, dong swangin', hickery dickery cock mother fucker. Now, quit lookin' at me funny and pay attention boy. I'm gonna learn you something. So eyes go outside, 'n' you know what I saw? A Goddamn twinklebell. I mean this.. boy had nothin' but suger in his tank. Not just queer, I bet this boy farts pink unicorns and pisses glitter. Now THAT, that is a special kinda queer. Mmmm, a three dolla bill ain't shit on that. So I just smiled the biggest smile, because this time eyes decided eyes gonna teach 'er a little lesson. You see, I know she spent Friday night at his house and her friend Beck's. I had breakfast with Becky's dad right before I went out to do the feedin'. Us farmers stick together like that. So I hear from Becky's dad that my daughter ain't been there in days. Yep, she was fornicatin' alright, with a twinkie. I-know-I-know, as a father I shoulda been more outraged. There are times you have to let them make their own mistakes. Make their won bed... and liiiiiiiiie around in it. This was one of those time. So I reach out to shake the... boy's hand with a \"Glad to meet you, son. Nice to see a respectable haircut too. Kids these days don't understand what a high n tight says about a man.\" \"Richard!\" my wife exclaimed. \"Dad\" my daughter exclaimed. \"It's OK. Thank you very much sir. You have a really nice and welcoming family. I appreciate that, a lot\", the boy replied in a voice a bit too high and a bit too sing song. Like he was trying out for Cats or something. Damn queer. So I went back to watching Fox News. I could smell something cooking, was it stir-fry? I wasn't sure but I know I didn't smell any meat. Who da fuck fixes dinner without meat? Fuckin' queers. And why was he in the kitchen with the women. God damn this one was fruity. Maybe my plan was backfiring. I had to right this ship. So I started to get up and walk to the dinning room. \"Richard, oh, there you are. We just finished setting the table. Dinners ready. Have a seat.\" \"What did you three, or two, ladies fix up? It smells... divine.\" \"Richard! You said you would behave\" my wife admonished, again. \"Come on, you can't date my daughter if we can't rib each other. Seriously, it smells really good. What is it?\" \"Becky made a stir-fry. She is a really good cock. I know you will love it\" \"Becky? Becky who? Why is everyone lying about something and why is Becky's name in the middle of....\" Then I realized. It all made sense. And my rage meter was pegged. Talking past the red line. Like 12,000 RPM.

It's a mystery how kids these days will ever learn to make it on their own.\n\nAs I was pulling the car into the garage, it started to rain, setting the tone for the rest of the day. I had a sense that something was off with this boy. It was around two, maybe two-thirty, and I was just settling into my chair with the remote in one hand, a beer in the other, and Fox News on the television. To top it off, Trump was on. Just then, the doorbell rang, and I knew something was amiss. I overheard my wife speaking in hushed tones with someone at the door, prompting me to head to the kitchen to eavesdrop.\n\nAfter the door closed, I realized that secrets were not going to be kept in my house. I quickly put on some pants and headed to confront the situation. I saw a young man outside, who I can only describe as flamboyant. I couldn't help but smile, knowing that it was time for me to teach my daughter a lesson.\n\nI had a suspicion that my daughter had spent the previous night at his house, rather than her friend Becky's as she claimed. I had breakfast with Becky's dad earlier that day, and he confirmed my suspicions. So, when I greeted the young man, I did so with a smile, acknowledging his respectable haircut and making a subtle comment about the significance of a high and tight haircut on a man.\n\nMy daughter and wife were surprised by my behavior, but the young man responded graciously, albeit in a high-pitched and theatrical manner. I returned to watching Fox News, noticing a stir-fry cooking in the kitchen. I couldn't help but wonder why there was no meat in the dish, and why the young man was in the kitchen with the women. It all seemed a bit too peculiar for my liking.\n\nAs dinner was served, my wife urged me to behave, but I couldn't resist making a few remarks.

Its position on the pole can be adjusted, so that it can be read either standing or sitting. The pole serves as the book's spine, and its pages fan outwards in a perfect cylinder nearly a foot and a half across. It has no beginning and no end. Its length is impossible to estimate. The pages of the book are infinitely compressible, so that even though the book appears as a solid mass of paper, I can easily part the pages and compress them to half their size, a quarter, a third. A fraction of the book contains an arbitrary number of pages, perhaps even as many as the book itself. At first, I felt as if my task was in fact a great blessing. The book is infinite, and contains all of human knowledge and all knowledge denied to us. It has a narrative, I am sure of that, but one so long and convoluted that I cannot even begin to comprehend it. It stretches on infinitely and touches on everything. I read the history of the world and the history of a thousand worlds separate from ours. Some of the characters were fanciful, and some I faintly recognized from a past life, rendered to me in perfect detail so that I knew them more intimately than I ever did before. I read pages of utter nonsense, letters repeated seemingly at random, and then later on detailed instructions to pull meaning from from those ciphers. At those times I paged back frantically, terrified that I would no longer be able to find the previous pages, and that some portion of the book would be obscured to me forever. I read treatises on philosophy and mathematics that left me breathless with wonder, more enlightened than any human soul still alive. I read an accounting of my own soul, and the judgement that sentenced me to this fate, and found it utterly unimpeachable. But I soon realized that where the book was infinite, I was but a speck in comparison. I could not hope to retain even a fraction of what I read. It might take a hundred years, two hundred years, but eventually even the most dazzling revelations would fade from my memory. Trying to find old pages was impossible. The pages refused to fold or tear or accept any mark. All I had to mark my place was a single bookmark, a small strip of red cloth that clung to any page I pressed it to. I could not cut it, could not tear it; it refused to stick to more than one page at a time. It was all I could do to remember where I left off before I fell asleep, my head spinning with all I had learned. I was surrounded by wonders, but could only push on ceaselessly forward. Wonder replaced itself with hopelessness and paranoia. I considered myself utterly inadequate for the task. What was the point of having access to such knowledge when I was incapable of truly comprehending it? There were moments of dread when I sat half-convinced that there was some vital piece of information that I had forgotten, that I needed to continue. Even the first sentence I had read, when I first flipped through the book and arbitrarily chose a page to begin, even that was lost to me. I cursed and railed against myself, wishing I had burnt that sentence into my brain, repeated it to myself again and again the first thing upon waking. But instead I had allowed the beginning of the book to be lost, and now the ending seemed similarly out of reach. I now sought only to finish the book, in hopes that I could begin to comprehend it through its completion. Centuries passed, and certain passages began to seem familiar to me, as if I had read them before. The words were just familiar enough to give me hope, unfamiliar enough to make me doubt. When I began to suspect that my task had ended, that I had finally reached where I started and found understanding, I would come across something completely foreign and be forced to read on. For centuries still that maddened hope ate away at me, gnawed at me with every page. I obsessed over the possible explanations. If the book truly was infinite, I reasoned, it would contain every variation on every sentence. Perhaps these seeming repetitions were merely a product of having read up to this point. If one had studied the world in detail, would not everything start to seem familiar? On other days, I would conclude it was all part of my punishment. The book was shifting, the letters rearranging themselves on the page the moment I turned away, just different enough to make me doubt. The book was truly impossible to finish, warping itself simply to torment me. Or worst of all, perhaps it was merely my mind that had betrayed me. Perhaps I had read this all before, a hundred times before. Perhaps I'd gone maddened and senile with age, and could have finished my task a hundred times over if I wasn't too deluded to realize it. I sought either damnation or salvation. Instead I read on and on and on, constantly doubting myself, hating myself, hating the book. What I once found fascinating, I now viewed as some conspiracy to torment me, or alternately as an irrefutable sign of my own worthlessness. I fruitlessly sought to tear out its pages. I flipped desperately through the pages, carving notes onto my skin in futile attempts to prove or disprove my theories. I made brilliant conclusions and then the next day dismissed them as the work of a madman. The book gave me all the information I needed, confirmed and denied everything I could conceive of. I understood perfectly how this was a punishment worthy of hell Until today. Today I woke and the bookmark was lying on the floor. For the first time in an eternity, it had slipped from the book while I slept. Standing there, staring dumbly at the red scrap of cloth on the floor, I realized I was equally lost. I could not remember even the pages I had read yesterday. I flipped through the book and found nothing familiar. All my progress had been erased. This is an unprecedented event. I have read the histories of a thousand worlds, and this is something utterly new. It is a miracle. Praise be to God, praise be to God. God is merciful, and even in my damned state He has seen fit to ease my suffering. My long torment is over.

The old man with the long dark beard relied heavily on those staff, his dark blue robe tattered and dirtied a little; eyes as if they were holding centuries old of both pain and wisdom. My eyes then scanned his staff. Surely, if he plans to attack me, I can definitely overpower him.

What the fuck is your problem?!\" I demanded angrily. \"I do not deserve your forgiveness, I know,\" he muttered, his eyes glassed over, \"But I am calling upon your honor, and perhaps, your love for the land, for great distress and sorrow have plagued this world. You are the only one left able to deliver us.\" My hold on his collar tighten, for a while, I didn't even care that he was just a frail, old man who clearly wanted nothing to harm me. \"What the hell is that supposed to mean?

I saw the blood drain from their faces as they looked down the barrel of the gun. Slowly, they disentangled themselves from each other and stood up. I looked from one to the other. They were utterly identical in every way, right down to the way they both looked at me with fear and apprehension in their eyes. 'What is going on here?' I said desperately. 'She's my clone,' said the Alannah on the left. 'And she's evil.' 'No, you're the clone!' said right-hand Alannah. 'No, you are!' 'Both of you, shut up!' I yelled. They were practically nose to nose now, glaring at each other. I sighed. 'Look, I can't tell which of you is the real Alannah,' I said. 'It's me!' 'It's me!' They both said it exactly in unison.

The other Alannah nodded slowly. 'She's got a point.' 'Well, you are me,' smiled her twin. 'It makes sense that you would see things the same way.' I stood listening to their conversation in a daze. Then I shook myself. 'That's seriously what you want? For both of you to stay?' 'Why not?' said one. 'We've got the spare room. One of us can sleep there, and you and the other can take the main bed. Then we'll swap each night.' 'I think it could work,' said the other. She looked at me with a grin. 'Plus, you'll have twice the action.' My face went red as I lowered the handgun. 'That's not important,' I mumbled. In a louder voice I went on. 'Okay, whichever of you is the clone, you can stay.' They both visibly relaxed as I set the gun carefully on the worktop. One looked at the other. 'Want to go out and get some extra clothes? We'll need two of everything now.' 'Sure!' said the second Alannah. 'Just let me put on something nicer than this.
