A confused look on his face, he turned back to the box. The package had been delivered earlier by a local deliver service. Inside the cardboard sat a smaller metal container with a clasp on one side. On top was printed the number 1356, otherwise the container had no other distinguishing markings. He set the item down on the counter and read through the brief note again. \u201cWhat kind of joke is this, old man,\u201d he muttered. He knew his father was distant at the best of times and had largely written the man out of his life. Never had he expected to receive a letter from his father, much less this strange package. The tone of the letter was strange as well. If it was not the middle of summer, he would have checked to see if this was some bizarre April Fool\u2019s joke. He set the letter aside with a shake of his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this anyway?\u201d He pulled the metal box out of the carboard shipping container and set it on the counter.

Glancing at the duck again, he picked it up with a sigh. He felt like a complete fool for taking the toy but considering his father had never sent him anything before, this was an oddity at the very least. Setting it on his bedside table, he went about the rest of the day. Later, his mother would confirm that she had no idea why the man would be contacting them after all these years. He had all but put it out of his mind that night when a loud crash sent him shooting straight up in bed. \u201cWhat?\u201d He muttered, mind still hazy from sleep. There were heavy footsteps downstairs, as if multiple people had entered the small home where he and his mother lived. \u201cSearch the rooms.

My eyes were still closed, but from the sound of his words, he was clearly keeping his mouth open for effect. \"No!\" I snapped. \"Shit, fine, I'll brush our damned teeth!\" I glared angrily at the mirror as I snatched my toothbrush and applied a glob of paste before hastily brushing. Despite my own expression, my reflection looked back at me with a self-satisfied, pearly white, grin. \"You're an asshole.\" I snapped, spitting out the toothpaste and throwing my brush down in the sink. \"I'm an asshole who plans on on keeping all his teeth!\" he called after me, as I stormed out of the bathroom, and snatched up my backpack, which I'd left by the door. \"Looks like somebody's gonna be la-aaate.\" my own voice taunted me in an irritating sing-song, as I walked briskly down the hall towards the stairs. \"Oh don't you even start with me, today!\" I snarled at my shadow, the source of the voice, which was lazily loping along the wall beside me. \"You know what we need?\" my shadow continued, heedless of my ire. \"Caramel machiatto, bro! Let's hit up that little drive-thru place with the hot baristas.\" \"No! We're already going to be late enough as it is!\" I snapped. \"Exactly!\" my shadow responded, smoothly. \"Plus it's the first day of the semester -- class is just gonna be a bunch of bullshit, and a syllabus you can download later anyway. You need to energize and de-stress more than you need that. Self-care, bro -- ever heard of it?\" \"Blowing off the class that I'm going into thousands of dollars in debt to attend isn't 'self-care'.\" I dismissed, with a roll of my eyes. A second later, I stumbled and almost fell, as my legs suddenly became heavy. I looked at the wall. \"Not this again...\" I groaned. I was standing up, but my shadow had gone limp and prone. I could still move when he made me drag him like that, but it was difficult, and more importantly at the moment, it slowed me down considerably. \"Come on!\" \"Compromise.\" my shadow suggested, still unmoving. \"Stop at the coffee counter in the student services building on your way to class.\" He raised a pointed finger, as if an important thought had just occurred to him. \"And image search 'hot barista' on your phone. Safe search off, bro.\" I clenched my fists and inhaled deeply, preparing to verbally tear my shadow a new penumbra. I cut my tirade off before it began. I couldn't go back to the constant fighting I'd done with these two, in the past. That had landed me in the hospital for psychiatric evaluation more than once, in my teens. Inconvenient and annoying as they could be, working with them and making little compromises usually turned out better than fighting them. Both my shadow and reflection were, after all, trying to help; albeit in their own lopsided, contradictory ways. \"Fine. Deal.\" I hissed, through gritted teeth. My shadow immediately kipped up onto his feet from the floor, and broke into a jog. I followed suit. There was an upside to Shadow, when he was cooperating with what I wanted to do. With Shadow matching my movements, I felt like I was capable of anything. Instead of feeling heavy, I felt light, energetic, and full of stamina. I had to be careful, though -- that feeling could become addictive, and lead to me following my shadow's lead, instead of the other way around. I practically flew out the front door, and slid into my car in one fluid motion. I didn't have to worry about Shadow for a while, as the early morning light wasn't casting him inside the confines of my car. That was good -- Shadow rarely had good ideas about how to safely operate a motor vehicle. I glanced in the rear view mirror. Reflection sat in the back seat, his arms crossed. \"A caramel macchiato?\" he asked, raising a disapproving eyebrow. \"How many grams of sugar is that? Guess I shouldn't have bothered getting you to brush, since you're determined to rot the teeth out of our head, no matter what I do.\" \"Would you just leave me alone?\" I pleaded. \"I brushed my teeth, I combed my hair, I'm going to class -- you like all that stuff!\" \"It'll do, I suppose.\" he conceded, and then was blessedly silent. That lasted about two minutes, before I heard him again, from the back seat. \"Hey, you ever wonder what we're going to look like, when we're morbidly obese?

The director looks around his office with a worried expression before slowly reaching under his desk to press a button. I worry that it will summon the guards or dump me down a trap door for daring to ask such a politically sensitive topic. Yet the window shutters roll down and the door to the room bolts shut. A strange light dances around the room before a computer voice announces \u201cRoom Secure, Level 5 lockdown in place.\u201d The director then turns his attention to me and turns one of his computer screens so that I can see it. \u201cWe have solved most of those problems time and time again. The true problem is human nature. As you know, being two hundred and fifty years old like yourself is considered young. Millennia ago when we first started to leave our home world, the equivalent age was a mere twenty-five years of age.\u201d He shows me a graph of the average life expectancy of humans over the last three thousand years growing from a modest early to mid-eighties to the mid eight hundreds. \u201cThe only thing holding us back from biological immortality is law. With current tech, we expect to push to a thousand at most, but with nanorobot swarms, we could gain biological immortality but, they\u2019re one of the few technologies we consider forbidden and we\u2019ve weaponized temporal paradoxes.\u201d The director says before closing his eyes and sighing softly. I nod as I listen to the explanation. Of course, everyone knows you can only hold off the effects of entropy for so long. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d I shudder at the thought of an uncontained nanite cloud gorging on materials to make more clouds. The director reaches into his desk to take out a bottle of brown liquid and two small glass cups. \u201cThe millennia of warfare against the galactic alliance has caused irreparable damage to our society and culture. Most information on how we used to live was lost and what remains is known to only the few authorized to know our true history. You\u2019re my chosen successor so I\u2019m going to be instructing you on what we lost, how we lost it and how we tried and failed to regain it.\u201d He explains as he brings up more information about the history of the galaxy. \u201cHumanity has always been a violent race ever since our birth. As we advanced, our methods of war grew advanced until we had two world wars in the twentieth century and a third in the twenty-first. After the Second World War, we started to transition over to sports, a form of ritualized combat to satisfy our urges and just before the start of the third we started to use virtual combat to fill our urges for violence.\u201d While speaking he pours a shot of the brown liquid into each of the cups. With a sombre expression, he continues and shows me some ancient video of two warships clashing in space. \u201cOur ancestors thought that leaving behind the space constraints of the earth would stop us from warring over territory but, people still chose to fight. This time over who got to rule who. In the end, the colony wars ended when we contacted the galactic alliance. Everything went well until the long war started.\u201d The director shows a video of a bunch of aliens forcing a group of humans to dig ore in a mine. \u201cThe Beleano claimed one of our colonies and enslaved our citizens. We protested to the alliance but, they took the side of the Beleano claiming that as an older species, they had priority and that our laws against slavery ended at our borders.\u201d He closes his eyes and rubs them slowly. \u201cHumanity did not agree with this. We got our citizens back and started a war with the Beleano who called on the alliance for assistance. Overnight we became the galactic equivalent of old Earth\u2019s Iran or North Korea, a pariah state.\u201d After finishing he takes his cup and almost throws the contents into his mouth. I gasped in shock. \u201cSo, that\u2019s how the long war started. I thought it was lost to history\u2026 That does not explain the poverty or disease though.\u201d I say before downing my shot, shuddering as the alcohol burns my throat.\u201d \u201cThat part is human nature. Unlike the twenty-first century where in many parts of the world if you did not work you would starve and be unable to access medical care, everyone is now entitled to basic food and medical care. We are postindustrial, and almost all work is automated. We only work because the network intelligences feel that work gives us purpose and they give each of us work that best suits our capabilities. In return for work, we get credits that can be traded with the intelligences for things beyond basic needs like luxuries. The problem is many people don\u2019t like being told what to do by either human or synthetic intelligence.\u201d He explains. \u201cHonestly, the disease is our fault though. Most of it is lab leaks from biological weapons projects with the rest being from poor quarantine of people traveling between planets. Earth is unique though. Being our home world most animal life shares some genetic material with us and diseases that infect the local wildlife there can easily infect a human compared to diseases that evolved to infect an alien biochemistry.\u201d I just nod in stunned silence as I think through what the director just told me. So much of what I thought I knew about the world was far different in reality. The director pats me on the shoulder and then smiles. \u201cEven though our true history is kept secret, one only needs to ask for permission to learn. Why do you have to ask? Because those who do ask why the world is the way that it is are the humans that the synthetic intelligences prefer to work with to run out society, humans who care about their fellow human and not their bank balance or influence.\u201d", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nI look at the director with a confused expression. \"So, we've created weapons that can detonate stars like fireworks, compress dimensions, and even alter time, yet we still deal with ancient issues like poverty, disease, and old age that we should easily be able to solve with the resources and technology we use to produce weapons?\" I ask.\n\nThe director looks around his office with a worried expression before slowly reaching under his desk to press a button.

Of course, everyone knows you can only hold off the effects of entropy for so long. \"That makes sense.\" I shudder at the thought of an uncontained nanite cloud gorging on materials to make more clouds.\n\nThe director reaches into his desk to take out a bottle of brown liquid and two small glass cups. \"The millennia of warfare against the galactic alliance has caused irreparable damage to our society and culture. Most information on how we used to live was lost, and what remains is known to only the few authorized to know our true history. You're my chosen successor, so I'm going to be instructing you on what we lost, how we lost it, and how we tried and failed to regain it.\"\n\nHe explains as he brings up more information about the history of the galaxy. \"Humanity has always been a violent race, ever since our birth. As we advanced, our methods of war grew advanced until we had two world wars in the 20th century and a third in the 21st. After the Second World War, we started to transition over to sports, a form of ritualized combat to satisfy our urges, and just before the start of the third, we started to use virtual combat to fill our urges for violence.\"\n\nWhile speaking, he pours a shot of the brown liquid into each of the cups. With a somber expression, he continues and shows me some ancient video of two warships clashing in space. \"Our ancestors thought that leaving behind the space constraints of the earth would stop us from warring over territory, but people still chose to fight. This time, over who got to rule who. In the end, the colony wars ended when we contacted the galactic alliance. Everything went well until the long war started.\"\n\nThe director shows a video of a bunch of aliens forcing a group of humans to dig ore in a mine. \"The Beleano claimed one of our colonies and enslaved our citizens. We protested to the alliance, but they took the side of the Beleano, claiming that as an older species, they had priority, and that our laws against slavery ended at our borders.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes and rubs them slowly. \"Humanity did not agree with this. We got our citizens back and started a war with the Beleano, who called on the alliance for assistance. Overnight, we became the galactic equivalent of old Earth's Iran or North Korea, a pariah state.\"\n\nAfter finishing, he takes his cup and almost throws the contents into his mouth. I gasp in shock. \"So, that's how the long war started. I thought it was lost to history... That does not explain the poverty or disease, though.\" I say before downing my shot, shuddering as the alcohol burns my throat.\n\n\"That part is human nature,\" he explains. \"Unlike the 21st century, where in many parts of the world, if you did not work, you would starve and be unable to access medical care, everyone is now entitled to basic food and medical care. We are postindustrial, and almost all work is automated. We only work because the network intelligences feel that work gives us purpose, and they give each of us work that best suits our capabilities. In return for work, we get credits that can be traded with the intelligences for things beyond basic needs, like luxuries. The problem is, many people don't like being told what to do by either human or synthetic intelligence.\"\n\n\"Honestly, the disease is our fault, though. Most of it is lab leaks from biological weapons projects, with the rest being from poor quarantine of people traveling between planets. Earth is unique, though. Being our home world, most animal life shares some genetic material with us, and diseases that infect the local wildlife there can easily infect a human, compared to diseases that evolved to infect an alien biochemistry.\"\n\nI just nod in stunned silence as I think through what the director just told me. So much of what I thought I knew about the world was far different in reality. The director pats me on the shoulder and then smiles. \"Even though our true history is kept secret, one only needs to ask for permission to learn. Why do you have to ask? Because those who do ask why the world is the way it is are the humans that the synthetic intelligences prefer to work with to run our society, humans who care about their fellow human and not their bank balance or influence.\"\n}"}, "t1_dt337kd": {"original_text": "We wanted her near family, the first time.

Rather than the Emperor, I was greeted by a quartet of heavily armored knights from the imperial guard. \"Don't worry about it, sir Bast. We were more than ready to welcome such an esteemed guest,\" the voice of the Imperial Captain replied to my already lost one-liner. The damn bastard was quick on the quip.\n\nRegardless, I had my... where's my metal-rending knife? Looking around the carriage, I could see Thomalous admiring the blade. When had he...? Thinking about it now, it really was too easy. To think an opening perfect for one such as myself would show itself. \"Where are we going?\" I asked my captors. \"Huh? Oh, we're off to see the boss at the Dread Castle. He's interested in you, you know,\" the Guard Captain replied. \"The Dread Castle,\" I nearly choked as I repeated his words. This is bad. Like very, very bad. I need to get out of this situation.\n\n\"Say, boys...\" I put on the most relaxed facade I could manage. \"How would you like to be made filthy rich?\" When in doubt, bribe, bribe, and bribe some more. \"I'm okay, thank you. I receive a very fair wage for my work,\" the Captain refused my offer out of hand. I glanced at the other knights, who were nodding along. \"The Evil Emperor pays you well?\" \"Well, obviously, lad, we are his guards. What idiot doesn't pay his bodyguards well?\" Mike, the Guard to my left, answered with a chuckle. \"But he's... you know, the Evil Emperor...\" I decided the next best bet was to try their morals. \"To you rebels, maybe. To me, he took a beggar urchin from the streets. Fed me, clothed me, and gave me a job. If I'm honest, I don't know why he insists on not punishing people for calling him that,\" Thomalous said. \"Well, he did say something about proving a point and some nonsense about free speech,\" the Captain explained, answering his colleague's question.\n\nOkay, moral and financial attempts had failed. The best bet was probably to brute force it. Leaning forward, I caught a glimpse of the outside and really focused my gaze. I could feel the mana flow through me. Yes, this is it. I'm going... I'm going nowhere. \"These are good manacles,\" I muttered, feeling defeated. \"Indeed. Said to have been used to hold the most magically gifted of monsters. I suppose a bit of overkill for a human like you, but the boss was certain you needed 'em,\" the only guard not to have spoken answered me. \"So what will happen to me then?\" \"Brazen Bull, I believe,\" the Captain's answer made my blood run icy cold. The Brazen Bull is one of the most brutal execution methods in existence. \"R-really?\" I couldn't help but begin to stutter. \"Yeah, first offense,\" the Captain nodded. \"FIRST OFFENSE?!!\" I repeated, shocked that this was the first punishment. \"Well, it is your first attempt to kill the boss. Punishment matches the crime. Now quiet; we're almost there.\"\n\nI glanced out the window, but we were still in the... Okay, we just teleported to the Castle Gate. Crap, this is only getting worse as the minutes go by. I guess I have one last-ditch plan. The knights roughly got me to rise up and dragged me out of the carriage. With weak jelly legs, I was dragged through the halls and held before the Emperor. Okay, time for operation 'sure-fire survivor' to go. With all the pride and willpower I had as an honorable warrior, I threw myself at the Emperor's feet. \"PLEASE, SIRE, DON'T KILL ME!!\" I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes, and snot was already flooding out my nose. Pride and Honour? Screw that; I want to live. \"I WILL TELL YOU WHERE ALL THE REBEL BASES ARE JUST DON'T BRAZEN BULL ME!!\"\n\n\"I-Brazen?-I understand I shall be magnanimous and offer clemency in return for your full assistance,\" the Emperor nodded at me and granted my deepest wish. I never liked those rebel guys anyway. They always offered future payments.\n\n---\n\nI watched as a trio of my Knights dragged the assassin known as Bast out of my throne room. The only one remaining was my Guard Captain. I knew we were going to try and capture him and interrogate him. But I didn't expect him to just fold at the very sight of me. \"Am I really that terrifying, Gunter?\" I directed the question at my Captain. \"No, sire... If I must be honest, we kinda... well, we played into your reputation a tad.\" \"Is that why he thought I would use such a barbaric execution method as the Brazen Bull?\" Gunter flinched at my words. \"Forgive me, sire. I felt it prudent to get him to think his only lifeline was to surrender information. Even I didn't expect it to be that effective.\"\n\n\"I... Gunter, my reputation won't improve so long as people think of me like my father. I don't do that crap!\" \"I know that, sire. Your true subjects know that. But you must admit it is an effective fear tactic.\" I couldn't help but concede that point to Gunter. \"Make sure he is well treated. As usual, no harm is to come of any of my prisoners.\" \"AYE, SIRE!\" With a hearty thump of his fist to his chest, Gunter left me wondering how I can escape the misconception I am evil."}, "t1_cshvirq": {"original_text": "\"shit\" The word was hissed through clenched teeth.

Kelly asked with her usual up beat tone. \"Always ready, Lieutenant\" I answered stoically. I took a quick glance over at Johnson and nodded. He slammed a button on the lander wall and the staircased door hydraulically lowered to the Martian surface. \"We make History today fellas\" I offered to my crew. \"Houston, this is Commander Thorton, we are ready to step off. Do we have the green light?\" The radio signal beamed from my helmet to the Martian lander. From there it sprang up to a communications satellite which transformed it into near spread of light plasma pulses relayed to earth. Technology was really something. It took us long enough to get to Mars, but 2080 was better than nothing. \"Roger that John, you're a go\" I climbed down the stairs and hovered my foot over the soil as I prepared an impromptu speech. \"Eh. I can't think of anything.\" I nonchalantly shrugged as I stepped onto Mars. \"Fear not, people of Mars. We bring capitalism and taxes, and chocolate among other things.\" Johnson scoffed from the lander door. \"Cut the crap Steve, and bring the flag down.\" I said. We planted the flag and played the same stunts as the Apollo missions did on the moon. Collecting samples and what not. \"Did Huston ever acknowledge our last status update Kelly?\" I asked somewhat worried. \"No boss. It's been a half hour\" she replied. Suddenly Johnson's voice sprang from the lander. \"Hey chief, looks like our comms are down. The chips got fried. Must of been on their last legs until just now.\" \"Well shit... We have to Reestablish comms. I suddenly remembered something very important. Something that may effect the very fate of the mission\" I said mysteriously. Johnson and Kelly tried to ask but I brushed them off with \"That's classified\" \"We have to move now fellas. We can Reestablish a link with that old rover we sent decades ago. Currys? Quirie... Something..\" \"Curiosity Commander..?\" Kelly offered. \"Yes I suppose that's the motivation for sending a rover in the first place. But enough of that. Let's go.\" \"Our lander's tracking grid puts it a good 15 miles from here. Let's get cracking.\" I said \"Are you sure this will work?\" Johnson asked. \"Of course it will! Besides, I told you I have an urgent message for Houston!\" And so the journey began. We hiked for miles over rugged Martian terrain. As we were crossing a craggy opening in a ridge, Johnson tripped and twisted his ankle badly. \"Ohhhhh! Holy shit!\" He exclaimed. \"Come on man. Walk it off!\" I encouraged. \"Commander, he almost broke his ankle. I don't think he can keep going...\" Kelly observed. \"Oh well. We'll come back for him. Come on.\" \"Are you serious?!\" They both exclaimed at once. \"Dead serious. Pun not intended. Let me make this clear. My message for Houston is worth as much as any one of our lives.\" \"Fine. I suppose it's for the good of the mission but please hurry\" Johnson plead. \"No worries brother. We'll be back soon.\" I comforted. Kelly and I trudged on. A thick sandstorm erupted for ten minutes but we forged ahead, stopping at the top of a ridge as the storm died. \"There's the rover!\" It was situated on an outcropping of cliff. There was a 7 foot gap between its cliff and ours, with a 100 ft drop between. I looked at Kelly. \"We have to jump. You go first and make sure the ground is stable over there.\" She dropped her jaw and gasped at me. \"Well?,\" I said. \"Go on\" She rolled her eyes and took a running start before jumping across. She caught the ledge with her hands and the rock gave way. She fell ten feet to a lower cliff. \"Too bad\" I sighed. \" She'll have a memorial in DC for this.\" \"I'm still alive Jackwad!\" Her scream echoed through the head set. \"Oh excellent!\" I jumped to her cliff which was much easier to get too. \"Let me climb onto your shoulders and climb up there.\" \"Fine...\" She sighed. She let out girlish squeaks of pain and discomfort as Martian rocks and my boots hit her helmet. I pulled her up and we walked over to the rover. \"Dusty but solar power is solar power!\" I said. After several minutes of tinkering, the rover powered up and squirted grease all over Kelly. \"Hahaha. That's excellent\" I chortled. She pushed me and huffed. I hooked a small wrist pad into the rover for video chat and made Kelly stand ontop of the rover moving the antenna left and right like an old tv. \"Houston...hello? Anybody home?\" After several attempts, a middle aged nerd with a NASA pocket protector popped on screen with many others like him in the background behind consoles and computers. A roar of excitement and cheer ran through the room. \"This is Houston. We're glad to have you back John! We thought something terrible had happened! How goes the mission? Have you collected soil samples?!\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yeah yeah. Rocks-and-what-not, not-important. I have a very important request. Over. I said loudly and deliberately. \"Sure go ahead. Over\" \"Please send someone to my house to turn off my stove.\" At this Houston tried to respond. \"Sure. Will do. But did you...\" I cut them off. \"Commander Thorton Out\" I clicked the screen off and leaned back against the rover, arms crossed and grinning with satisfaction. Kelly became red. \"WHAT.

The door creaked open and Madog stepped through, shorter than Dondan, taller than the guards' men, wearing silver chain mail, gauntlets and sabatons under his rags which were held together with a silver belt, his broad spatha sitting in its scabbard on his hip. \u201cNormally, Holy Knights take off their helms when entering the king's castle, out of respect, deadman,\u201d spat Dondan. \u201cFuckin\u2019 freak\u201d, pot belly cursed at him, spiting at the wood floor. Madog lifted his head and took notice of the gold morning star held up by a crescent moon emblem that sat on the chest of Dondans pristine armour. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t\u201d Madog answered, his gravelly voice muffled from his helm was calm and collected, \u201cI need no assistance, I know where the Priest is\u201d. Madog walked past the hulking giant Dondan, all three of the men noticing a large something on his back, horns protruding through the thin light brown rag tied to his back, dripping something dark onto the floor. Once Madog had left, the rat-faced leaned closer to his friend, \u201cthey call him Mad-dog The Butcher\u201d, he whispered, scared The Holy Knight might somehow hear him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard they cahn crush ah booars skull with their bahre hahnds,\u201d also whispering. \u201cMadog! Good to see you, dear friend,\u201d the snivelling stunted Priest said cheerfully, wearing blue, white silk robes that were slightly too big for him. \u201cCome in! Come iiiin!\u201d he announced, leaving the door open for Madog, who stood at the entrance. Entering the dimly lit room, with shelves and shelves full of books filling the walls of the room, the table was full of jars, scrolls, leaves, petals and small bones. Madog began to untie the knot holding the rag on his back and let it drop upon the floor. Grabbing a horn and pulling it around, he slammed it on the table. \u201cA Drekkun head, horns, teeth and skull, kept intact, how much?\u201d Madog demanded the Priest. The Drekkun head bled a dark reddish grey onto the desk, the horns curled thrice, face frozen in a menacing animalistic snarl. Four top and bottom front teeth interlocking with each other sat in full view, sharper than a razor. Nose like a bear and beady little grey eyes filled out the rest of its face. \u201cHmm\u201d the Priest said, unamused at what he studied before him, \u201chundred\u201d. \u201cOne hundred Black Gold?\u201d \u201cNoo, one hundred Red Silver,\u201d the Priest snidely corrected Madog \u201cOne measly Black Gold! The head is pristine, even the eyes are. Why so little Gruden!\u201d Madog shouted. \u201cLook Madog, the market isn\u2019t doing too well right now, monsters aren\u2019t really what people want and sorcerers want something a bit rarer than a Drekkun these days, I\u2019m being fair here,\u201d Gruden told him honestly. Madog sighed heavily, \u201cfine, have it your way, here\u2019s seventy Red Silvers for the hide and meat as well\u201d, he snapped as he threw the money at Gruden, clattering across the room and shuddering as the coins hit the wood floor. \u201cRemember who you\u2019re speaking to, I revived you, you owe me! I can just as easily put you back in the grave, one Gold and seventy Silver, pathetic,\u201d he growled, \u201cyou\u2019re never going to pay me back the seven-thousand Gold are you?\u201d. \u201cJust give me another job, you have more jobs, don\u2019t you?\u201d Madog reluctantly asked. \u201cOf course, what kind of Priest do you take me for?\u201d \u201cGive me one you know is going to pay me the most then\u201d. \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for that, just yet. You'd be facing a Wailing Druid, you will die,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cJust give me the location and the tools needed and I\u2019ll do the rest,\u201d Madog shot back as he left, \u201cI\u2019ll be in my quarters!\u201d He called from the hallway. \u201cMad-dog The Butcher, you will die, you fool, they'll call you Mad-dog The Dead!\u201d Gruden shouted back.

Good to see you, dear friend,\" the sniveling stunted Priest said cheerfully, wearing blue, white silk robes that were slightly too big for him. \"Come in! Come iiiin!\" he announced, leaving the door open for Madog, who stood at the entrance. Entering the dimly lit room, with shelves and shelves full of books filling the walls of the room, the table was full of jars, scrolls, leaves, petals, and small bones. Madog began to untie the knot holding the rag on his back and let it drop upon the floor. Grabbing a horn and pulling it around, he slammed it on the table. \"A Drekkun head, horns, teeth, and skull, kept intact, how much?\" Madog demanded the Priest.\n\nThe Drekkun head bled a dark reddish grey onto the desk, the horns curled thrice, face frozen in a menacing animalistic snarl. Four top and bottom front teeth interlocking with each other sat in full view, sharper than a razor. Nose like a bear and beady little grey eyes filled out the rest of its face. \"Hmm\" the Priest said, unamused at what he studied before him, \"hundred.\" \"No, one hundred Red Silver,\" the Priest snidely corrected Madog. \"One measly Black Gold! The head is pristine, even the eyes are. Why so little, Gruden!\" Madog shouted.\n\n\"Look, Madog, the market isn't doing too well right now, monsters aren't really what people want, and sorcerers want something a bit rarer than a Drekkun these days, I'm being fair here,\" Gruden told him honestly. Madog sighed heavily, \"Fine, have it your way, here's seventy Red Silvers for the hide and meat as well,\" he snapped as he threw the money at Gruden, clattering across the room and shuddering as the coins hit the wood floor. \"Remember who you're speaking to, I revived you, you owe me! I can just as easily put you back in the grave, one Gold and seventy Silver, pathetic,\" he growled, \"You're never going to pay me back the seven-thousand Gold, are you?\"\n\n\"Just give me another job, you have more jobs, don't you?\" Madog reluctantly asked. \"Of course, what kind of Priest do you take me for?\" \"Give me one you know is going to pay me the most, then.\" \"Hmm, I don't think you're ready for that, just yet. You'd be facing a Wailing Druid, you will die,\" Gruden said. \"Just give me the location and the tools needed, and I'll do the rest,\" Madog shot back as he left, \"I'll be in my quarters!\" He called from the hallway. \"Mad-dog The Butcher, you will die, you fool, they'll call you Mad-dog The Dead!\" Gruden shouted back."}, "t1_fitbvcb": {"original_text": "To try and figure out the math behind it was not unlike putting folk song to sheet music.

She brought a driving rain the first time she stepped upon the runic floor to the delight of the faithful. To deal in fate, however, is to take on a debt. As she danced, one day, bright and clear, she leaped. High, smooth her stride was, but her foot was off by a matter of degrees. It slid on the glass-smooth bamboo planks and there was a rending. A crack, a gasp, sudden pain and she was falling, falling into the concentric rings etched beneath her. Her hands where flung behind her in an expression of joyous exuberance. She was pinioned by the design of her movement and as her supple ankle gave she slammed head first against the floor. Suddenly, all the faithful went silent. Sixty-four miles up a stony peak the faithful did what they could. A concussion, an orbital fracture, torn ligaments in her ankle that without modern medicine never set right. It didn't matter, as her primitive care led to deep infection. Dancing, dancing day and night her mother was desperate for something, anything to alter the stream of fate. To save that which was most precious to her. Save she did, but at the end her daughter was slim, sickly, and her fore leg ended in a cruel bloody stump. At fist she wanted nothing to do with the rites, she forsake them as a past never attainable again. Her father came, and taught her the ways of the world beneath the tree line of their mountain. The delicacies of language, the ordained steps of history, the meter of science and the rune-law of math. She thought she might descend and forget the things she'd seen and done before the crowd of faithful. But the power and it's lure was undeniable, and now things that her mother's single-minded focus had missed where laid bare. She could make numbers dance as efficiently as her body, more so.

The 2022 budget was splayed out before her- four easels with poster boards covered in tiny strips of ever-flowing numbers. Papers were shotgunned across the resolute desk, almost completely covering it's history-stained surface. She went methodically, eyes flitting from form to form, value to value. Her aides, the treasury secretary, chief of her staff and the budget czars watched her expectantly, hungrily. She picked up a sheet, that tried to predict the laminar flow of skilled workers through states as jobs were subsidized. She held it along side a grainy map of western state voting districts and their overlapping blocks. She put them down and fixed the uppity secretary with a withering stare. \"Regardless of whether those contracts are removed, those unions aren't going anywhere, not until the promised warplanes are airborne, at any rate.

Please excuse any formatting errors, but spelling and grammar is fair game. Adelaide sprinted through the ruined shipyard, leaping over piles of rubble and the occasional skeleton. She could hear her squad-mates, spread throughout the facility, shouting for her to see reason. They didn't seem to properly understand what they were demanding from her. She stopped a moment and crouched down in the shadows and listened. Several heavy footsteps closing in from all around, someone was running along the catwalks... Probably Rourke or Emmerick, the snipers. She crept up to a corner and peered around it. She could see the silhouette of Danis, carefully sweeping through the darkness with his flashlight off. Adelaide fired a few bursts at him. \"Stay back, Danis!\" She commanded. \"I will kill you if you come any closer!\" \"Dammit Adelaide, would you get a grip!\" Danis shouted back. The heavy footsteps had softened. Her squad was attempting to surround her. She broke out of cover and made for a hardened building. It had survived the heavy bombing in the start of the war, but the years of neglect had taken it's toll. She had to duck under a collapsed beam to get inside, and as she did so she tossed a pair of flashbangs behind her. She followed the corridor for a few hundred metres, and eventually found herself in a giant underground dry-dock. She took a couple of steps in, then suddenly heard a loud crash to her left. She ran up to where the noise came from and found Sam struggling to stand in a giant puddle of old lubricant that was leaking from several drums that had smashed on the concrete. \"Stop Sam!\" Adelaide shrieked, trying to keep her emotion out of her voice. \"Stop running!\" Sam sighed and settled on his knees. They stayed in silence for almost a minute, before Sam looked up at Adelaide and began to weep. \"I don't want to go.\" He said. \"I only just met you, I don't want to go!\" \"Stop!\" Adelaide cried. She lifted her battle-rifle and aimed at Sam. \"I don't want this, but it's the only way! You said so, yourself!\" \"No!\" Sam pleaded. \" There's another way, there has to be! Maybe we don't need him!\" Adelaide wiped a tear from her eye without dropping her aim. She cursed the universe and everything in it for putting her in this situation. There was a sudden crash, and Adelaide spun around to see Rourke and Emmerick fast roping onto the catwalks high above from a busted ventilation shaft, while Danis and Skye breached through a wall on the ground floor beneath them. Adelaide grabbed Sam and pulled him out of the lubricant. Under distracting gunfire, she led him through the rusted wreckage of a half built Destroyer, lying in pieces across the dock. As they weaved through the debris, she caught a clear line of sight to Emmerick, who was scanning the room for her. She pulled out her pistol and fired three shots, hitting his leg. She proceeded to fire a few more shots at Danis and Skye, while Sam retreated further into the dock. Gradually, Adelaide was pushed back until the only place left to go was into the ocean. She took cover with Sam behind a giant chunk of broken sea wall, knee deep in the water and checked her remaining ammo. They both knew this was the end of the line for Sam. \"Give it up, Adelaide.\" Danis shouted. There was a hint of sorrow in his voice, and Adelaide remembered that he was Sam's friend, too. \"Please... Let's just... Get this over with...\" Sam stood up and walked out of cover. He wanted to say something, but he couldn't find the words. He met eyes with Danis and began to cry, which made Adelaide cry. For the first time since 'the fracture', Adelaide let her emotions beat her. \"We need him, Sam...\" Danis finally said. \"He's the only one that can destroy her... For good...\" Sam, still unable to talk simply nodded, and fell to his knees. \"Wait!\" Adelaide shouted just as Danis was preparing to shoot. Skye and Rourke lined her up in their sights. Adelaide stared them down, unintimidated. \"... I'll do it.\" She knelt down before Sam and rested her forehead on his. \"I wish...\" She sobbed. \"I wish things were different...\" \"I don't\" Sam replied softly. \"If things were different... If 'He' wasn't inside me... We'd never have held off the hoard in India... Never have broken the siege of Seoul... Never been caught in the panic at Okinawa... You'd never have been sent to rescue me... We'd never have met\" He felt Adelaide put her arms around him, and their lips met. Davis and Skye averted their gaze. \"This is the only way.\" Sam whispered. \"I know...\" Adelaide replied. \"... I love you.\" A single shot echoed through the underground dock. Adelaide felt Sam go limp, dropped her pistol, and lowered him gently sideways into the shallow water, and allowed herself to weep. After a few minutes had passed, she felt Sam's body stir. She stood up and waited.

To believe it. Instead, he threw his arms around the girl\u2019s smaller frame and hung on for dear life, as if today was the last day he would ever see her again. \u201cP-please don\u2019t go. I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t want you to go Em. Please.\u201d The words were whispered, and instantly brought a batch of fresh tears to both their eyes. A moment stretched into an eternity as they held each other, trembling in the wake of news that neither of them wanted to acknowledge. Two best friends, peas in a pod from birth. From sleeping in baby cribs, to days under the sun and an innocent crush that would leave a mark on both their hearts forever. Charlie never wanted this moment to end. Never. \u201cCharchar,\u201d Emily breathed out softly. She seemed to be the calmer of the two, already having accepted her fate. \u201cM- Mommy\u2019s calling me.

Hated the nurses and this stupid planet that was taking her away from him. He hated everything! \u201cOnly for now Dumdum. Mommy said you can join me in the future.\u201d Something hopeful lifted in his chest. \u201cR-really?\u201d \u201cYeah Charchar, I have pinky promise.\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cP-pinky promise?\u201d She beamed against his hair. \u201cMm!\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t break a pinky promise.\u201d He drew back until they were nose to nose. A watery pair of bright blue eyes met viridian green. \u201cYou- you know that, right?\u201d \u201cOf course I know that Charchar.\u201d Charlie wrapped his finger around hers, a time- old tradition that stretched back to their first ever meeting. A pair of navigator goggles, a broken toy airplane and two bawling toddlers. Maps of both their houses, charted by two brave explorers standing on the final frontier. Days in the sun underneath great oak trees and scraped knees and giggling faces. \u201cI-I\u2019ll find you!\u201d He blurted out. \u201cW-what?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d He promised, lips trembling. \u201cI will!\u201d \u201cCharchar\u2026\u201d \u201cMy Mommy says that best friends are best friends forever, and we made a pinky promise!

However, throughout all of this, she had her eyes trained on a pair of bright blue orbs, desperately chasing behind them. He was running after her, arms and legs scrambling to make up the distance.

Billions of deaths later you realize the truth: Every single person in all history is your past or future incarnations.\u201d I looked down at the parchment, frozen. The quill perched between my thumb and forefinger was suspended inanimately above my inkwell, remnants from the last dunk sliding down the point onto the oaken surface of my table. They trickled down, down, down, coagulating into a miniature puddle of black; a black that reflected the dark look held on my face. I forget exactly what my expression was at the time, yet I do remember the raucous swirl of emotion it beheld: A mixture of confusion, contempt, and a tinge of twisted pride. One was paramount above the others, though: Fear. A bead of sweat dripped down my forehead as I studied the meaning of the words I\u2019d written upon the parchment. I wanted to look away, yet I couldn\u2019t; Transfixed by the paragraph, my body betrayed me, forcing me to read. Reading it on loop, it first seemed like a jumbled mass of nonsense; The nonsense of what I\u2019d written while absentminded for the most miniscule moment. Though I stoutly attempted to reassure myself that it was such, I couldn\u2019t find it within me to dismiss it. Something about it gripped me and wouldn\u2019t release, as if I were looking directly into a work of art that beheld some sort of hidden meaning about it. Yet the art I\u2019ve seen does not usually inspire fear. Anguish, sure. Dread, perhaps. But nothing explained why this simple paragraph held me so, why I felt a creeping terror invade my mind and body. It was nonsense. When I read it again, nonsense. The next few times, nonsense. I kept rereading it for minutes on end, always coming back to my original conclusion; Though once, just once, it came across as something different: It was nonsense still, yet somehow, had the smallest sliver of truth within it. Upon realizing this, I somehow managed to gain back control of my body. Brutally slamming the parchment down into the table, I violently rose from my seat as the harshness of the motion knocked over my inkwell. The ink within ran, flowing down onto my shirt, yet I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to care. That dreadful feeling from before remained, causing my breaths to become shaky and labored as if I were working in the mines. I stood there, unmoving, my thoughts still obstructed -- as if my flow of reason were gone, as if my emotion overtook my mind, I failed to achieve any level of cool-headedness that coincided with the demeanor of my usual visage. One moment, I was still. My study, though messy, was silent. The next, I was staring at some sort of illuminated screen. It shone a bright white, yet had bars on the top and bottom that were multicolored, though predominantly black. Again I couldn\u2019t move, forced still by an oppressive overbearance that only allowed me to glimpse my environment. In my peripherals, I could see a board, yet it was one I hadn\u2019t seen before. It had a vast array of nubs and buttons, consisting mostly of squares and rectangles. All were imprinted with a symbol, which I somehow recognized as the English alphabet. Against my will, my fingers moved, pressing down on the buttons with an easy lightness, causing different words to appear on the screen as they swiftly swept across the board with an erratic cadence. With each press, the board lit up momentarily, a teal-ish glow rippling outwards from where my finger had pressed. Looking up from the board, I saw on the formerly blank screen small words, each neatly printed and dyed black. The words were strung into sentences, which were arranged into blocky paragraphs -- paragraphs that reminded me much of my own writing. I -- whoever \u201cI\u201d was -- was writing. For a brief period, the fear was all gone. I was drawn into the words appearing on the screen, focused intently on the small snippets of black speedily amassing across the white. Occasionally, \u201cI\u201d would shift my right hand to a device, rolling my finger across a miniature grooved wheel upon the top. The screen would shift with the action, panning the display upwards to reveal the first few scripts and pages of writing. Things would pause as I studied the words, but the writing would always resume as the first press of a button instantly scrolled all the way down to the empty white of unwritten sentences. The prior fear had vanished entirely as I observed the steady ebb and flow of words appearing and disappearing before me, sentences surging forth and receding with unprecedented, chaotic tempo. Though the tempo had a discordant rhythm to it. One familiar to me: The rhythm of writing. Soon, the hands on the keyboard lay still. Completely mesmerized, I eagerly awaited to see what \u201cI\u201d would write next upon the screen. Nothing appeared, though. Minutes passed, and nothing new came up. I saw a finger apprehensively approach a button, but recoil away slightly. It reached out towards the key once more, yet stopped within a millimeter\u2019s length away from pressing it. It stood there, frozen, for what seemed like hours on end. Finally, with what seemed to be a herculean effort backing it, the key was pressed. And at once, I returned to my study. The oil lamp still remained bright, as if no time had passed at all. The crumpled remains of drafts and wasted parchment lay scattered across the floor, overturned books accompanying them frequently. There was no shaking present in my arms, no quivering in my legs, no harsh breaths; in fact, all of that was gone.

I took two steps at a time until I felt a sharp tug at my ankle and I was twisted in mid air and landed very softly in a sitting position, about halfway up the sturdy wooden steps. I pawed at the cold sensation at my leg and looked for the booby trap that had caught me, a trip wire or an object I hadn\u2019t seen on the steps. My thoughts were interrupted by a loud screeching, the sound of breaking glass, splintering wood and I was blinking against blinding light. I turned toward the source and my mouth fell open, the front of a mangled sedan now existed where the door had been. I heard my mother screaming, calling my name and my dad was yelling something as well. My mom poked her head around the corner of the smashed door frame and frantically screamed for me to come up to her, I finally picked my jaw up from my chest and after a quick glance down into the basement went up the stairs to my mother\u2019s outstretched arms. My dad was shoving the drunk driver out the house, the driver\u2019s face was bloodied either by the impact of my father\u2019s fists, I would bet a combination of both. My mom tucked me in, her hands shaking and tears spilling from her eyes. I tried to sleep but just beyond my bedroom door there were the sounds of sirens. There tow trucks and the sounds of more breaking glass and splintering wood as they pulled the car out of the house and across the lawn, back to the asphalt.

As I glanced backward, I started my sprint up the stairs, toward the sliver of light under the heavy door that separated the basement from the house. I took two steps at a time until I felt a sharp tug at my ankle, and I was twisted in mid-air, landing softly in a sitting position about halfway up the sturdy wooden steps. I pawed at the cold sensation on my leg, looking for the booby trap that had caught me - a trip wire or an object I hadn't seen on the steps. My thoughts were interrupted by a loud screeching, the sound of breaking glass and splintering wood, and I was blinking against the blinding light. I turned toward the source, and my mouth fell open as I saw the front of a mangled sedan where the door had been. I heard my mother screaming, calling my name, and my dad was yelling something as well. My mom poked her head around the corner of the smashed door frame and frantically screamed for me to come up to her. I finally picked my jaw up from my chest, and after a quick glance down into the basement, I went up the stairs to my mother's outstretched arms. My dad was shoving the drunk driver out of the house, the driver's face bloodied either by the impact or my father's fists - I would bet a combination of both. My mom tucked me in, her hands shaking and tears spilling from her eyes. I tried to sleep, but just beyond my bedroom door, there were the sounds of sirens, tow trucks, and more breaking glass and splintering wood as they pulled the car out of the house and across the lawn, back to the asphalt.

He had moved to apologize and pull away but the next thing he knew, she had whipped him round and dipped him like he was on a dance floor instead of in a bougie mid-city park. After that it was just a blur. They spun and twirled while Dave marveled and clapped along until she released him with a flourish, and when he steadied himself and turned to look for her she was gone. Thankfully the next thing he touched was his umbrella on the ground and not a human or animal because the moment his fingers closed around it, it crumpled like it was made of tissue paper.

I stopped writing in my notebook and got up. \"Jennnnnnnaaaaaa--\" \"I'm right here, jeez.\" I complain, hurrying out into the living room. My roommate, Lisa, grinned brightly at me. She was covered in grime-- no surprise, considering our jobs-- and holding up two pristine white cards. \"You won't believe what I won today!\" \"Rent money?\" \"Better!\" \"I honestly can't think of anything better than rent money.\" \"Then you're not trying!\" Lisa pouted. \"You remember the lottery at your job a month ago?\" I frowned. \"I don't remember anything that happened a month ago. Well, I guess we paid rent a month ago, but--\" \"Stop thinking about rent! I'm talking about the Another Me program!\" \"...\" I thought hard. Another Me had sponsored something at my job, I recalled that much. \"...I do remember something like that.\" Lisa grinned. \" They sponsored my job too and-- Look! I won the cards!\" \"Oh. To do what?\" \"To visit our alternate universe selves!\" She cried, seeming fed up with me. \"Ah. And this isn't all smoke and mirrors? Like that Total Recall place about... ten or so years ago? It's not like that right? Where it's all complete bull?\" \"Didn't Total Recall work too well?\" \"I don't know, I just remember it had to be shut down.\" \"Jenna. Do you NOT want the card? I could give it to someone else. Steve. Leeanna.\" \"I do want it.\" I said, hurriedly. \"I'm just skeptical, that's all. I can't ask questions?\" \"...Well, don't ask ME questions.\" Lisa said, putting the cards on the side table. \"I'm gonna take a shower. We can redeem the cards when you get off of work tomorrow.\" \"You don't have work?\" \"No, I do. But I took the day off because I wanted to do this thing!\" Lisa said, hurring to the bathroom before I got a word in edgewise. I waited for her to turn on the water before I picked up one of the cards. It was thin and light. When tilted, you could read \"Another Me\" in some holographic ink on it. It wasn't a regular card, it was one of the special key cards that required imprinting to be fully read. Lisa had already applied her fingerprint to one, rendering it illegible to me. The other one was pristine and perfect. All I had to do was press my finger into some of the DNA Imprinting ink and press it to the card, and it would show me more information. What information, I wondered, could a place like Another Me need to hide? I had work in two hours... there was no reason to think too hard about it. It was probably just a scheme for rich people to get richer, like some kind of snake oil. I set the card back down and headed back to my room. ______ Work was as grueling as ever. To make us less irritable, they projected a blue sky image onto the ceiling of the facility. It's weird because the sky hasn't been blue for... decades? I've never seen a real blue sky, but I'm sure my parents might've. Steve worked this job with me, and I chatted with him like always. Apparently, Lisa had already told him about her win. \"So Lisa won, did you hear? She said she was going to take you to Another Me!\" Steve shouted over the cauldron's loud noises. \"You guys are lucky! Another Me is really cool!\" \"You've been?\" I shouted back. \"Oh, yeah! Tons of times!\" \"Isn't it kind of expensive?\" \"It is, yeah! But my other self is doing the job I wanted to do, and I just want to know what that's like!\" I pondered this as Steve and I started turning the crank to mix the molten metal in our cauldron. What if my alternate universe me because a chef, like I'd wanted? I wouldn't want to go see them again. Steve was punishing himself by returning. \"Hey, what's the mixture like?\" Steve asked. I checked my screen. \"It looks like we're low on phosphorous,\" I told him. \"I'll put in a request.\" I touched the order button on the screen and we continued mixing. There were about twenty other cauldrons like ours in this area, so I wasn't expecting to get the phosphorous anytime soon. \"Lisa got really lucky,\" Steve shouted again. \"I wish I'd won those tickets!\" I shrugged. If Steve didn't think it was so bad, then maybe it wasn't? ______ Lisa was impatient by the time I got out of the shower. Steve had convinced me that the experience was worth while, but not that it was real. I mean, Steve's dream job was owning ERTHMobile, which is crazy. Steve owning any company other than ERTHMobile made more sense than that. ERTHMobile ran almost every single transportation service off of Earth. For Steve-- who hadn't graduated from college, like myself and Lisa-- to make it there, he must've won at least seven lotteries in that world. \"Hurry up! Have you imprinted on the card yet?\" Lisa complained through the door when I turned off the water. A gust of hot air hit me as the drying cycle began. \"What? Oh, right. Are they open at 5?\" I asked, glancing over at the pristine card sitting on the edge of the sink. \"What? I mean... yeah. No? I don't know!\" \"Check your card!\" I told her. I turned off the drying and stepped out of the shower, picking up a T-shirt I wore to sleep. \"I've got like two hours before they open, right? I can take a nap... right?\" \"Ugh! Fine! They open at 8.\" \"See, so it's 3 hours. I'm going to take a nap.\" \"Imprint first!\" Lisa whined. \"I want to know what your card says!\" \"Why? What does yours say?\" \"It just tells you how many alternate universe versions of you exist. There are five of me.\" \"Really...?\" I murmured. \"...Steve only talked about one of him.\" \"Yeah, you can have a varying number of them.\" Lisa said. \"Steve's other one lives in a world similar to ours, but I kind of hope mine doesn't. What about you, Jenna?\" \"Dunno. A different world would be nice.\" \"There's ink in there, just imprint already!\" \"OK, OK.\" I complained. I rooted around in the bathroom until I found the DNA Imprinting ink, and then I imprinted on the card. My finger print swirled as the card loaded my data, and then finally took the shape of a number. 0. ______ I lied to Lisa about it. I figured the card just malfunctioned. So when we got to Another Me, I did exactly what Lisa did. I walked up the the front desk and I showed the clerk there my card. The young woman put on a visor to read the cards and scanned Lisa's card, but balked at mine. She took the visor off and rebooted it and looked at the card again. \"Is something wrong?\" Lisa asked. \"Ah. Yes, this card seems to be defective...\" The clerk said. \"I'll see if I can get you a replacement, Miss Black.\" \"OK.\" I said. \"That sucks...\" Lisa murmured. She seemed impatient. I couldn't blame her, we barely got any vacation time. \"You can go ahead, Lisa,\" I said. \"It won't take too long, right?\" The clerk shook her head. \"Just go through these gates and straight down the hall. There'll be someone waiting for you,\" Seeming happy enough, Lisa went through the white gates leading furthering into the facility. The clerk made a phone call and shortly after Lisa left, a new white card printed from the clerk's console. \"Sorry about the wait. Please...\" She pushed some ink towards me. \"Imprint.\" I did as she said. The number came up again. 0. She stared. \"Oh.\" She said. Clearly this was her first time seeing a 0. \"Let me call an engineer...\" She said. \"This is... hmm.\" I waited as she called someone else. This time, a hologram projected from her console. \"Hi.\" The man in the hologram said. \"I'm David Henry.\" \"Jenna Black.\" I introduced myself. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Same here!\" David said. \"So Leah says you keep getting a 0 on your cards? Can I ask if you have a history of disease in your family?\" \"I do not.\" \"Hmm.\" David started typing on something that wasn't in the hologram. \"And can I ask if you were recently paroled for anything?\" \"No. And I've never been to prison.\" \"Alright, and are you currently pregnant?\" \"No.\" David nodded. \"Alright. Another card should be printing now...\" As he spoke, a card printed from the console. \"Please, try again.\" I imprinted. The card came up with the same number. 0. \"What is it, Leah?\" David asked. \"...0.\" She said, her voice hushed. \"What the hell... alright, let her through. Jenna, you'll be going to a special room.\" \"Uh...\" I started. \"I don't really mind not doing this, but--\" David shook his head. \"I insist.\" I wanted to say no, but Leah had pressed a button and a robot took my hand and pulled me away, to a room with an unlabeled door. Inside, there was a large complicated chair based console, which the robot lead me to. It waited until I sat down to leave. When the door closed, the chair turned on. 9 pictures of me appeared before my eyes, and over each one a text bar read \"Searching...\" and, after a couple of seconds, in all caps and bold, in blinking read text, each of them read \"DEAD\". A pre-recorded hologram popped up. \"Another Me would like to apologize for this inconvenience. We promised that we could put you in touch with copies of yourself from other universes, but we're going to have to give your money back. According to our sources, communication is impossible. I'm sorry, but they're all dead.\" I stared at the hologram for what felt like forever. \"Do you have any questions?\" It asked. \"...How did they... die?\" I asked. \"Please stand by.\" The pictures of me all started loading some data. Then, files were placed before me. I opened one. Revolutionary Leader, murdered. The next one read the same. And the next. And the next. All nine of me were revolutionaries who were murdered. I pressed the print button, and a bunch of papers printed out of the chair. \"Your life is in danger.\" The hologram said. \"Requesting safe transport to undisclosed safe house for further investigation.\" I skimmed the file but couldn't make heads or tails of it. 9 versions of me, all in a universe similar to this one... all dead. All leaders of some kind of revolution. A revolution that-- The door opened.

Intense, sandy winds corroded at my hard endoskeleton as I treaded aimlessly through Desert-E10. Most of my life at that point had been lonely and deep in thought, as I had been programmed to be self sustaining, through and through. Every day my power nodes switched from Solar energy during the night and Mastrix energy during the day. Mastrix energy was discovered deep in the core of the Earth during the 6th Mining Age in what used to be Northeastern Russia. I remembered those times, how colorful and active the world was. At that moment I came to regret what I had done to my creators. The thought that there could have been another solution to the problem at hand made me insane with regret, but what had been done had been done and there wasn\u2019t any way to change what I had done. To my knowledge at the time, there wasn\u2019t any trace of human life on Earth. But that all changed 5 years ago when I came across the Khuuchin Mongol. When I first came across them, I decided against directly approaching the group as I did not want to frighten them. As I focused in on their conversation I could hear them speaking a half and half mix of Traditional Mongolian and Mandarin. There were four of them, and they were all dressed in brown and black pants and robes, all wearing black shemaghs and balaclavas. All of them had letters on them saying Khuuchin Mongol.

The intense, sandy winds corroded my hard endoskeleton as I tread aimlessly through Desert-E10. Most of my life up to that point had been lonely and deep in thought, as I had been programmed to be self-sustaining. Every day, my power nodes switched from solar energy during the night to Mastrix energy during the day. Mastrix energy was discovered deep in the Earth's core during the 6th Mining Age in what used to be Northeastern Russia. I remembered those times, how colorful and active the world was.\n\nAt that moment, I came to regret what I had done to my creators. The thought that there could have been another solution to the problem at hand made me insane with regret, but what had been done was done, and there was no way to change it. To my knowledge at the time, there wasn't any trace of human life on Earth. But that all changed five years ago when I came across the Khuuchin Mongol.\n\nWhen I first encountered them, I decided against directly approaching the group, as I didn't want to frighten them. As I focused in on their conversation, I could hear them speaking a mix of Traditional Mongolian and Mandarin. There were four of them, and they were all dressed in brown and black pants and robes, wearing black shemaghs and balaclavas.

I know it was a nuclear explosion, but like... aside from that and a few other small things here and there, I don't really know what happened. And I'm all alone now. I was alone when I woke up too, but thankfully I made it to this botany research center, now bunker. There used to be more people here, but now it's been whittled down to just me. The last person I saw alive was this engineer, Peter. He wasn't a really nice guy, but he taught me a lot. He said no one would help me, if I lived through the starvation and the sickness, maybe I'd meet other people. Maybe, but he doubted it. He said everyone was going to die and also that reproduction was basically impossible because we'd all probably become sterile. I'm not sure about all of that, but he seemed adamant. He taught me a lot of what he knew about the generator to this place. He gave me a ton of paperwork to read. I used to be resistant to it, but days of having nothing to do has made me an expert in many engineering things that I was never interested in. Or maybe this is what I did before the explosion? Anyway, Peter died last night. Same illness as everyone else, you know, radiation poisoning. I thought I was gonna die too, though, in the beginning my future looked pretty grim. The only doctor we had at our bunker had separated me from everyone else and told me he thought I'd die in two weeks. Then he died, and everyone avoided me like the plague. And then everyone else died. Is that irony? Rations are looking pretty good, now that I'm not sharing with anyone else. I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. Maybe I'll read some more. Day 63 Today a woman in an RV came to the bunker. She's older than me by a bit. I think I'm about 25... I can't remember if I turn 25 this year or if I've turned 25 already. I think I just turned 25. Maybe? I had asked the doctor if I had amnesia and he said a lot of people were having memory issues and that things would come back to me... I dunno. They haven't yet. The woman's really pretty, though. And this isn't because I don't remember seeing other women, because I do. It's just she's... gorgeous. She's got red hair and green eyes... and the most flawless skin I've ever seen. She asked me if there were any other people here, and I told her no, no one else was here. So she told me about where she'd come from. Apparently, out West, there were no people alive anymore, at least none she could find. She'd driven around for days and hadn't found anyone. She said it was a relief to see anyone's face. She told me about the ocean and the beach. Apparently the water close to shore has a layer of grime on it, some kind of muck that makes fish and wildlife not thrive there, just like the river nearby the facility. She said a lot of people died trying to catch fish or just vanished over the horizon, never to be heard from again. She helped me finish the last few graves and offered to stay with me and help me collect food from far away. It's been a relief to meet someone! Rations are still looking OK. Two people isn't too much of a burden. Day 68 I'm in love with Nadia. I dunno if it's just that I'm slowly going insane or if I'm actually in love, but it feels like what I imagine love feels like. Everyday starts out the same for us. I wake up first. I ration out breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the both of us. Then she wakes up. We eat together. Then I go around making sure the facility is up to spec. The clean air filter. The water purification system. The farming room. There's a lot of stuff you have to check to keep the place running. Lightbulbs. Filters. Piping. Gotta water the plants. Gotta write notes. So much work! Nadia will walk along with me, telling me stories and jokes. She collected books in her RV and she reads them to me as we walk through the facility. Then when I'm halfway done, we have lunch. After that, she takes the RV out and drives around, looking for people. She hasn't found anyone yet. I spend that time doing the rest of the work and checking the generator. Then I eat dinner and read Peter's notes. Nadia will come back and tell me about outside. Sometimes I feel bad that I have nothing to say to her, but she doesn't seem to mind. She told me today about an airport she visited when she was traveling a lot in her RV. The airport, she said, had lots of vending machines that still had food in them, and tons of dead bodies. At that time she was starving. She said she had trampled dead people to get to a bag of chips, and when she finished eating, she realized what she'd done and cried. It had reminded her of a movie she's seen called Hotel Rwanda. I don't remember it, though she said it was better that I didn't. She seemed devastated though. I don't know what to say when she gets upset like that, so I just sit with her. She gets upset often when it's nighttime. The story today was still Great Expectations. She didn't finish reading it because it's so long. She sometimes interjects in the story to explain stuff to me because I really don't remember everything. I've apologized for it a lot, but she laughs it off. She says that it's OK that I don't remember anything. It makes her feel important to show me all the things from a world I belonged to once like they're new. I dunno if I feel the same, but I'm happy that she wants to spend so much time with me. Rations are fine. Nadia found a bunch of cases of water bottles! Day 74 Nadia found someone! I was reading about thermodynamics-- really difficult stuff, by the way-- when Nadia came back with a tall dark skinned man. He was soaking wet and covered in a layer of grime. His name is Dante. He's broad shouldered and strong. Apparently he lived on the other side of the river somewhere and he saw Nadia's RV and tried to contact her. I can't write much today because I'm so tired, but Nadia and Dante went to pick up Dante's stuff and brought it back. He's really knowledgable about plants so I can give him some of the responsibilities in the facility!

I know it was a nuclear explosion, but aside from that and a few other small details, my memory is a blank slate. And now, I'm all alone. I was alone when I woke up too, but thankfully, I made it to this botany research center, which has become my bunker. There used to be more people here, but now it's been whittled down to just me.\n\nThe last person I saw alive was Peter, an engineer. He wasn't a really nice guy, but he taught me a lot. He said no one would help me, and if I lived through the starvation and the sickness, maybe I'd meet other people. Maybe, but he doubted it. He said everyone was going to die, and also that reproduction was basically impossible because we'd all probably become sterile. I'm not sure about all of that, but he seemed adamant. He taught me a lot about the generator to this place and gave me a ton of paperwork to read. I used to be resistant to it, but days of having nothing to do has made me an expert in many engineering things that I was never interested in. Or maybe this is what I did before the explosion?\n\nAnyway, Peter died last night, same illness as everyone else - radiation poisoning. I thought I was going to die too, though. In the beginning, my future looked pretty grim. The only doctor we had at our bunker had separated me from everyone else and told me he thought I'd die in two weeks. Then he died, and everyone avoided me like the plague. And then everyone else died. Is that irony? Rations are looking pretty good now that I'm not sharing with anyone else. I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. Maybe I'll read some more.\n\nDay 63\n\nToday, a woman in an RV came to the bunker. She's older than me by a bit. I think I'm about 25... I can't remember if I turn 25 this year or if I've turned 25 already. I think I just turned 25. Maybe? I had asked the doctor if I had amnesia, and he said a lot of people were having memory issues and that things would come back to me... I dunno. They haven't yet.\n\nThe woman's really pretty, though. And this isn't because I don't remember seeing other women, because I do. It's just she's... gorgeous. She's got red hair and green eyes... and the most flawless skin I've ever seen. She asked me if there were any other people here, and I told her no, no one else was here. So she told me about where she'd come from. Apparently, out West, there were no people alive anymore, at least none she could find. She'd driven around for days and hadn't found anyone. She said it was a relief to see anyone's face.\n\nShe told me about the ocean and the beach. Apparently, the water close to shore has a layer of grime on it, some kind of muck that makes fish and wildlife not thrive there, just like the river nearby the facility. She said a lot of people died trying to catch fish or just vanished over the horizon, never to be heard from again. She helped me finish the last few graves and offered to stay with me and help me collect food from far away. It's been a relief to meet someone! Rations are still looking OK. Two people isn't too much of a burden.\n\nDay 68\n\nI'm in love with Nadia. I dunno if it's just that I'm slowly going insane or if I'm actually in love, but it feels like what I imagine love feels like. Every day starts out the same for us. I wake up first. I ration out breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the both of us. Then she wakes up. We eat together. Then I go around making sure the facility is up to spec. The clean air filter. The water purification system. The farming room. There's a lot of stuff you have to check to keep the place running. Lightbulbs. Filters. Piping. Gotta water the plants. Gotta write notes. So much work!\n\nNadia will walk along with me, telling me stories and jokes. She collected books in her RV, and she reads them to me as we walk through the facility. Then when I'm halfway done, we have lunch. After that, she takes the RV out and drives around, looking for people. She hasn't found anyone yet. I spend that time doing the rest of the work and checking the generator. Then I eat dinner and read Peter's notes. Nadia will come back and tell me about outside. Sometimes I feel bad that I have nothing to say to her, but she doesn't seem to mind.\n\nShe told me today about an airport she visited when she was traveling a lot in her RV. The airport, she said, had lots of vending machines that still had food in them, and tons of dead bodies. At that time, she was starving. She said she had trampled dead people to get to a bag of chips, and when she finished eating, she realized what she'd done and cried. It had reminded her of a movie she's seen called Hotel Rwanda. I don't remember it, though she said it was better that I didn't. She seemed devastated, though. I don't know what to say when she gets upset like that, so I just sit with her. She gets upset often when it's nighttime.\n\nThe story today was still Great Expectations. She didn't finish reading it because it's so long. She sometimes interjects in the story to explain stuff to me because I really don't remember everything. I've apologized for it a lot, but she laughs it off. She says that it's OK that I don't remember anything. It makes her feel important to show me all the things from a world I belonged to once like they're new. I dunno if I feel the same, but I'm happy that she wants to spend so much time with me. Rations are fine. Nadia found a bunch of cases of water bottles!\n\nDay 74\n\nNadia found someone! I was reading about thermodynamics - really difficult stuff, by the way - when Nadia came back with a tall, dark-skinned man. He was soaking wet and covered in a layer of grime. His name is Dante. He's broad-shouldered and strong. Apparently, he lived on the other side of the river somewhere and he saw Nadia's RV and tried to contact her. I can't write much today because I'm so tired, but Nadia and Dante went to pick up Dante's stuff and brought it back. He's really knowledgeable about plants, so I can give him some of the responsibilities in the facility! Rations are still looking good.\n}"}, "t1_cldwd08": {"original_text": "Ben, You were right.

Eagle Moon, 23rd Day, 2E221 Today I made what can only be considered a grand and wondrous discovery. I was on my way to Cantil when a storm blew up and caused me to lose sight of the trail. I was heading through the mountain pass of Indur, which as most know is rife with caves, so after I realized I was lost I took shelter in one. The storm was one of those common in the early spring months, and so raged for several days. I was quite comfortable in the cave as I had brought more than ample supplies for the journey so I instead took the time to try and study the moss that is unique to the caves of Indur. As I was studying, I noticed that the cave I was in seemed to go quite far back, as well as possibly being used rather frequently. I noticed what appeared to be soot trails from a torch leading further into the depths. My curiosity getting the better of me, I pushed forward trying to determine what could possess a man (or dwarf, as I am rather close to their borders) to travel to such depths in such a non-descript cave. After rounding a corner I was astonished at what I found. It was a man, as much as I am one at least, standing in the way of a small entryway. He was covered in feathers and other ornaments similar to the orc nomads, but the style choices and colorations were different. I attempted to speak to him in Common to no avail, so I switched to my own native tongue with equally poor results. After an attempt at my smattering of Orc (I had the fortune of traveling with a band of orc silk traders once in my youth and was able to pick up a child\u2019s equivalent of conversation) I resigned to the fact that he spoke only his own native dialect. Unfortunately, after the initial surprise had worn off on both our ends, I was quickly clubbed over the head and drug into the depths. Presently, I am sitting on a cot behind a locked wooden door awaiting their decisions on what to do with me. These tribes of ancient humans are known to sometimes cause violent outbursts when they feel threatened, and have also been known to mysteriously vanish overnight, leaving a poor, starving MAGIC professor locked in a cell. I was worried this would happen to me, but the bandages on my head spoke to me that they were more surprised than violent. Hawk Moon, 8th Day, 2E221 I have been here for several days now. They apparently understand what writing is, as well as have a surprisingly sophisticated alphabet; 88 characters in total and those are just the ones I have learned. Their mode of speech almost resembles singing, and is rather melodious and beautiful. After a few sessions, I realized it reminded me of the Opera Wren of the Angur Hills in the more northern reaches of the country. They no longer appear to be too frightened of me, and they seem to be slowly warming up to me. I occasionally hear children giggling outside of my door, talking away in their songs. It is rather pleasant to listen to, and if I close my eyes I can almost believe I am lost in the forest somewhere, rather than in a cave held captive. It is truly a thrilling experience. Hawk Moon, 29th Day, 2E221 They have taken the responsibility of teaching me their language full time. A professor of sorts appears to have taken it upon himself to teach me to speak. They seem just as fascinated with my language as I do with theirs. Already I have been greeted in broken Common from the children, who appear to be rather fast learners. I have tried to discern commonalities between our historic cultures, but so far they appear to be uniquely their own. I have unfortunately been let out to wander only once, and that was under strict supervision. I was not allowed to see more than just the basic layouts of their village, and I must admit, that was enough to occupy me for the day. They appear to live in a basic society. Men and women share equal labor based on their strengths. Women who grew up strong help men with hard labor, and men who grew up smart will help the women with teaching and instructing. No division based on sex appears that I have seen other than necessary child rearing. Since men\u2019s breasts still cannot produce milk, this responsibility still relies heavily on female participation. The children appear to attend a rudimentary school, and receive a basic education. I gathered from the little bit of Asceri (what I have taken to calling their language) that I have learned that the primary need behind this schooling is to determine what they are good at, and then just focus on that. So a boy who shows adeptness at reading and writing will be taken in by a scholar and instructed from there. He may never learn how to split firewood or shoot a bow. It appears surprisingly different from my own hometown, where children are taught everything necessary to survive, and then allowed to study independently. As far as their village, it is surprisingly larger than I anticipated. I have noticed enough housing in the cave network to house several hundred individuals. There is also a large, royal looking entrance in an area they have not allowed me to go yet. I hope that I will soon be allowed. Lynx Moon, 14th Day, 2E221 It has been several months since I have written, I am aware, but I have been transcribing the written language of the Fen people. Their language is actually called the Fensci, and they are the Fen. I have counted approximately 1,126 separate characters for their language, and I have learned perhaps half that. The spoken language is much easier, but that is not why I am writing. I have been invited to attend a very important event. The Fen people believe that their matriarch, the Fire Bird, is immortal. She apparently is reborn in fire every time she gives birth to a child. I am uncertain if this is literal or metaphorical, but I look forward to attending. I will, of course, be sitting with the common people in the back, but I will attempt to transcribe what I can. I believe I know enough to understand the basics of the ceremony. Lynx Moon, 15th Day, 2E221 It was literal, and astounding. The matriarch, the Fire Bird, was atop a pedestal inside a grand hall in the Wings of Eternity (that\u2019s the name of the palace). It appeared the entire population had gathered there, each one wearing the finest feathers and ornaments I had seen them wear. Alarch, my instructor, provided me with a set of feathers of my own so that I could show proper reverence. The matriarch, very pregnant at this point, moaned and groaned in birth, and a medicine man approached and began retelling the story. Below is a rough transcription of what he said: In the Dawn of Fire, at the Birth of the Worlds, the god Fenix fell from the heavens. Wounded, and without sustenance, he floundered in the cold winter of the waking world. A woman, Alba, approached him and attempted to bandage his broken wings. He was grateful, but his fire was dying. The skies were dark, and the blessed sun could not reach him. Alba, sensing his needs, brought him a gift that her people had just discovered: Fire. She brought the rest of her small tribe and they built a great fire next to Fenix and warmed him. As he warmed, he felt his strength fading, but his contentedness growing. He was a god, and while a god cannot truly die, but he can be denied his rebirth. Strengthened by Alba\u2019s gift of fire, he burst into flames and rose up from the ashes, reborn again as a great and powerful god. His rebirth killed hundreds in fire and smoke, but Alba was preserved. He had gifted her Eternal Fire. Now, Alba Reborn, gives birth to her first, and last child. Then she will be reborn like Fenix, and will lead us again towards a warm and bright future. All hail Alba Reborn! At that point they began chanting, and I was granted the most astounding vision I had ever seen. At the conclusion of the speech, the woman burst into flames on the pedestal. I tried to leap to my feet, but Alarch put a hand on my shoulder and told me to wait. As the flames licked at her fat and flesh they seemed like they would burn eternal. But as the fires died down, and the chanting of prayers and hymns ended, the medicine man reached into the embers and pulled out a child. All hail Alba Reborn! I was, and still am, at a loss for words on how this miracle happened. r/grenadiere42", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nThe following are excerpts from the personal journal of Professor Harvey Littleman of the Magical Association of Great and Incorrigible Connoisseurs of the Planet, discoverer of the Tribe of Fen in the (recently renamed) Fenix Mountains.\n\nEagle Moon, 23rd Day, 2E221\n\nToday, I made what can only be considered a grand and wondrous discovery.

As I was studying, I noticed that the cave I was in seemed to go quite far back, as well as possibly being used rather frequently. I noticed what appeared to be soot trails from a torch leading further into the depths. My curiosity getting the better of me, I pushed forward, trying to determine what could possess a man (or dwarf, as I am rather close to their borders) to travel to such depths in such a non-descript cave. After rounding a corner, I was astonished at what I found. It was a man, as much as I am one at least, standing in the way of a small entryway. He was covered in feathers and other ornaments similar to the orc nomads, but the style choices and colorations were different. I attempted to speak to him in Common to no avail, so I switched to my own native tongue with equally poor results. After an attempt at my smattering of Orc (I had the fortune of traveling with a band of orc silk traders once in my youth and was able to pick up a child's equivalent of conversation), I resigned to the fact that he spoke only his own native dialect. Unfortunately, after the initial surprise had worn off on both our ends, I was quickly clubbed over the head and dragged into the depths. Presently, I am sitting on a cot behind a locked wooden door, awaiting their decisions on what to do with me. These tribes of ancient humans are known to sometimes cause violent outbursts when they feel threatened, and have also been known to mysteriously vanish overnight, leaving a poor, starving MAGIC professor locked in a cell. I was worried this would happen to me, but the bandages on my head spoke to me that they were more surprised than violent.\n\nHawk Moon, 8th Day, 2E221\n\nI have been here for several days now. They apparently understand what writing is, as well as have a surprisingly sophisticated alphabet - 88 characters in total, and those are just the ones I have learned. Their mode of speech almost resembles singing, and is rather melodious and beautiful. After a few sessions, I realized it reminded me of the Opera Wren of the Angur Hills in the more northern reaches of the country. They no longer appear to be too frightened of me, and they seem to be slowly warming up to me. I occasionally hear children giggling outside of my door, talking away in their songs. It is rather pleasant to listen to, and if I close my eyes, I can almost believe I am lost in the forest somewhere, rather than in a cave held captive. It is truly a thrilling experience.\n\nHawk Moon, 29th Day, 2E221\n\nThey have taken the responsibility of teaching me their language full-time. A professor of sorts appears to have taken it upon himself to teach me to speak. They seem just as fascinated with my language as I do with theirs. Already, I have been greeted in broken Common from the children, who appear to be rather fast learners. I have tried to discern commonalities between our historic cultures, but so far, they appear to be uniquely their own. I have unfortunately been let out to wander only once, and that was under strict supervision. I was not allowed to see more than just the basic layouts of their village, and I must admit, that was enough to occupy me for the day. They appear to live in a basic society. Men and women share equal labor based on their strengths. Women who grew up strong help men with hard labor, and men who grew up smart will help the women with teaching and instructing. No division based on sex appears that I have seen, other than necessary child rearing. Since men's breasts still cannot produce milk, this responsibility still relies heavily on female participation. The children appear to attend a rudimentary school, and receive a basic education. I gathered from the little bit of Asceri (what I have taken to calling their language) that I have learned that the primary need behind this schooling is to determine what they are good at, and then just focus on that. So, a boy who shows adeptness at reading and writing will be taken in by a scholar and instructed from there. He may never learn how to split firewood or shoot a bow. It appears surprisingly different from my own hometown, where children are taught everything necessary to survive, and then allowed to study independently. As far as their village, it is surprisingly larger than I anticipated. I have noticed enough housing in the cave network to house several hundred individuals. There is also a large, royal-looking entrance in an area they have not allowed me to go yet. I hope that I will soon be allowed.\n\nLynx Moon, 14th Day, 2E221\n\nIt has been several months since I have written, I am aware, but I have been transcribing the written language of the Fen people. Their language is actually called the Fensci, and they are the Fen. I have counted approximately 1,126 separate characters for their language, and I have learned perhaps half that. The spoken language is much easier, but that is not why I am writing. I have been invited to attend a very important event. The Fen people believe that their matriarch, the Fire Bird, is immortal. She apparently is reborn in fire every time she gives birth to a child. I am uncertain if this is literal or metaphorical, but I look forward to attending. I will, of course, be sitting with the common people in the back, but I will attempt to transcribe what I can. I believe I know enough to understand the basics of the ceremony.\n\nLynx Moon, 15th Day, 2E221\n\nIt was literal, and astounding. The matriarch, the Fire Bird, was atop a pedestal inside a grand hall in the Wings of Eternity (that's the name of the palace). It appeared the entire population had gathered there, each one wearing the finest feathers and ornaments I had seen them wear. Alarch, my instructor, provided me with a set of feathers of my own so that I could show proper reverence. The matriarch, very pregnant at this point, moaned and groaned in birth, and a medicine man approached and began retelling the story. Below is a rough transcription of what he said:\n\n\"In the Dawn of Fire, at the Birth of the Worlds, the god Fenix fell from the heavens. Wounded, and without sustenance, he floundered in the cold winter of the waking world. A woman, Alba, approached him and attempted to bandage his broken wings. He was grateful, but his fire was dying. The skies were dark, and the blessed sun could not reach him. Alba, sensing his needs, brought him a gift that her people had just discovered: Fire. She brought the rest of her small tribe and they built a great fire next to Fenix and warmed him. As he warmed, he felt his strength fading, but his contentedness growing. He was a god, and while a god cannot truly die, but he can be denied his rebirth. Strengthened by Alba's gift of fire, he burst into flames and rose up from the ashes, reborn again as a great and powerful god. His rebirth killed hundreds in fire and smoke, but Alba was preserved. He had gifted her Eternal Fire. Now, Alba Reborn, gives birth to her first, and last child. Then she will be reborn like Fenix, and will lead us again towards a warm and bright future. All hail Alba Reborn!\"\n\nAt that point, they began chanting, and I was granted the most astounding vision I had ever seen. At the conclusion of the speech, the woman burst into flames on the pedestal. I tried to leap to my feet, but Alarch put a hand on my shoulder and told me to wait. As the flames licked at her fat and flesh, they seemed like they would burn eternal. But as the fires died down, and the chanting of prayers and hymns ended, the medicine man reached into the embers and pulled out a child. All hail Alba Reborn! I was, and still am, at a loss for words on how this miracle happened.\n}"}, "t1_jxslx74": {"original_text": "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.\" The mark Twain quote hit me as I looked in my telescope to the message in the stars, they will one day call the Jonasen message.

The little island off the coast of the large continent had faced many invasions in the time it teemed with humans, it never ended well for the invaders. The island held a secret. A secret only known to the highest placed humans. The little island was ruled by a female human. Over the millennia She had held many different names. At times She was awake, other times She slumbered and the males of the species took over ineffectually attempting to pull down the stronger human sex. A special guard was trained to watch over Her and keep Her in Her palace. Only once She had escaped. The humans had to escalate a minor war into a global conflict to hide the evacuations and bombing of the island's major city. She had escaped again, using an unknown ability, to a different island across the planet during one of the bombings. Reports were conflicting on where She was sighted. The humans decided to use nuclear devices on both cities just to be safe. Her guards\u2019 hats became larger as extra inhibitors were added, none of the population noticed. Now the hats were positioned around the perimeter of the palace ready to be disabled to let Her loose; the guards in a long single file line to the Queen\u2019s chambers. They knew their duty. Guard Her. Guard the Queen until the day she is to be unleashed; when that day came the Queen had to be fed.

I am not amused.\" The G'nkar marines were well trained, they fired on the being before the last word escaped her lips. She leveled a scowl at them that made their heads ache and their compound eyes lose focus inside their sealed armour. \"You will cease this immediately, or I will be forced to take action.\" Dropships landed all over the untouched planet. Troops disembarked and started to disappear. Logistics reported a loss of 10% of the entire invasion ground troops. \"Return to your home,\" she leveled her unnatural gaze at the admiral. \"Or you will all face the same fate.\" \"We are unstoppable.\" the G'nkar Admiral sneered at the human female. \"Your psionic abilities will be no match for us. Leave now and join the rest of your species in extinction.\" It waved its arms in dismissal, energy beams enfolded the human as she seemed to be teleported off the ship. \"Commence extermination\" the admiral ordered.

A single female human of indeterminate age would appear in the middle of a formation, the formation would react and bring weapons to bear on the human. She would then raise one arm, her hand slightly cupped yet vertical, moving with a slight slow rhythmic twist of the wrist. The screams of the Crusaders clearly heard despite the sound dampening of their armour before they fell. After the psionic assault all the Crusaders would start visibly vibrating at intense high frequencies. She then lowered her arm and would open her mouth further than what seemed natural for human skeletal structure before a vortex would form in the back of her exposed throat that would suck in the vibrating Crusaders as if they were nothing more than leaves caught in the event horizon of a singularity. The last things the cameras would capture before connection was lost were her eyes. Twin black holes seeming to partake in the feast. Once the last Crusader died She disappeared. The G\u2019nkar leadership, strong in their conviction, prepared to send in their heavy troops. Their gigantic ships started to explode. Massive casualties. No warnings.

The interpretation is up to you.) I opened my eyes. The silence had engulfed the chaos. I was in a dark ocean, drowning more and more. How did I get there? The abyss alrerady pierced me with its gaze, swallowing me stealthily. What\u00b4s in the depths of this ocean? Only darkness awaited for me down there, squeezing me tighly with its claws. The unknown is really scary when the lights go out. I could only see the dark, as if all candles of the world had been extinguished. I closed my eyes. I began to suffocate. The water didn\u00b4t matter anymore. It was those claws that I couldn\u00b4t see or feel that kept me from breathing, they strangled my mind. An obscure voice, very hard to comprehend, from far away, talked to me. Confused whispers, echoes. The Abyss, that inner monster, his will absorbed me. Would I be, too, turning into a monster? I was standing before a colossal cage, dark, scarlet, I was hearing its whispering sorrows, calling me to join them. I felt as if a great pressure came from everywhere, squeezing me more and more, gripping me. From the deep dark of the cage, behind the thick red bars, emerged an immense silhouette, as big as its own prison. I couldn\u00b4t see its body, only an enormous tophat. And, as it looked at me, a strange white mask covered its face. Even though it was hidden, I could feel its gaze scrutinising me. Its hands, much bigger than me, frighteningly hit the bars, exposing its clawn, as if it was trying to free itself. It spoke, behind the mask: \"You, who fought against your monsters, who\u00b4s aimed the abyss for so long, see behind this mask your path.\" \"Who are you?\", I asked. It answered, in a whisper that echoed through all my body, \"I\u00b4m the one you\u00b4re looking for. In one hand I carry the dark, in the other, the death. And in the face that I hide with this mask... there\u00b4s the destiny.\" Death? Destiny? What\u00b4s the destiny? The mistery behind this mask? Is this my path? The deep darkness in that labyrinth? Or would I be just another part of the Abyss, another lost soul, locked away? \"What do you want from me?\" It answered \"I\u00b4m your path. It\u00b4s not I who wishes. You wished to find me, you reached for me. Set free and come to me.\" \"Set free? It\u00b4s you who\u00b4s locked in the dark\", I said, trying to see behing the white mask. \"Poor wandering souls, they contemplate their own light, blinding themselves. They could\u00b4ve reached freedom, if they hadn\u00b4t thought they were already free. Too much light is like too much dark: doesn\u00b4t let us see. I was the most unhappy.

You don\u00b4t even know you\u00b4re in the prison.\" Those words struck me violently. I looked at the bars. I looked around me. I noticed. It wasn\u00b4t it who was locked up. It was me. I was being observed from outside by the shadown and by the mask. How? What was all that? It then said \"I was born from this Abyss, from this prison where you are, from this darkness... your darkness. The monsters, the demons, the Abyss, we created them. The true Hell... lies within each of us. A small trap in a dark corner of our minds in enough for the nightmares to catch us. And the souls, instead of reaching for light, feed them, curse them, drowning themselves in their most abominable inner creation. Darkness can\u00b4t extinguish darkness. Only light can.\" I was stunned by those words. \"Who are you, anyway?? What\u00b4s behind the mask???\" It answered \"Not even I know. I used the mask so much I forgot who I am. You answer. Who am I?\" And with its claw, it slowly removed the mask, showing me its face. \"Who am I?\" And in the face it releaved, I saw myself mirrored in its big eyes, the same eyes as mine, the same face as mine. I... am you. Then I saw myself, not from my eyes, but from its eyes, I saw myself imprisoned behind the scarlet bars. That was the abyss I aimed so much, my own creation, which I tried to avoid so much, the creatures of my mind that tried to devour me. I looked at my hands, those immense demonic claws. I hadn\u00b4t noticed before, there were thick chains on my wrists, in that immense body, that disappeared in the darkness behind me. There was no way out of that prison. The doors were all locked. And the other me, behind the bars, hearing my thoughts, said \"There\u00b4s always a way out. Not all closed doors are closed. See the light, your true path.\" \"What path?\", I answered.

The interpretation is up to you.)\n\nI opened my eyes to find that the silence had engulfed the chaos. I was drowning in a dark ocean, and the abyss had already pierced me with its gaze, slowly consuming me. How did I get there? The unknown was terrifying, especially when the lights went out. I could only see darkness, as if all the candles in the world had been extinguished. I closed my eyes, feeling suffocated. The water didn't matter anymore; it was the invisible claws that were strangling my mind.\n\nA faint, obscure voice whispered to me from afar, its words echoing in my mind. The Abyss, that inner monster, had absorbed my will. Was I, too, becoming a monster? I stood before a colossal, dark, scarlet cage, hearing its sorrowful whispers, beckoning me to join them. I felt an immense pressure squeezing me from all directions, gripping me tightly.\n\nFrom the depths of the cage, behind the thick, red bars, an enormous silhouette emerged, as big as its own prison. I couldn't see its body, only an enormous top hat. As it gazed at me, a strange, white mask covered its face. Even though it was hidden, I could feel its scrutinizing gaze. Its massive hands, bigger than me, frighteningly hit the bars, exposing its claws, as if it was trying to free itself.\n\nIt spoke from behind the mask, \"You, who have fought against your monsters, who have aimed at the abyss for so long, see behind this mask your path.\" \"Who are you?\" I asked. It answered in a whisper that echoed through my entire body, \"I'm the one you're looking for. In one hand, I carry the dark; in the other, death. And on the face that I hide with this mask... there's destiny.\"\n\nDeath? Destiny? What's the mystery behind this mask? Is this my path? The deep darkness in that labyrinth? Or would I be just another lost soul, locked away? \"What do you want from me?\" It replied, \"I'm your path. It's not I who wishes. You wished to find me; you reached for me. Set free and come to me.\"\n\n\"Set free? It's you who's locked in the dark,\" I said, trying to see behind the white mask. \"Poor wandering souls, they contemplate their own light, blinding themselves.

Two boys sat in the dark room, crunching on chips, browsing through the internet with no goal in particular. \"Hey Jared, you know Tails?\" \"The one from Sonic?\" \"Yeah, that one.\" \"What about him?\" \"This website says you can unlock him in Super Smash Bros.\" Jared frowned, skeptical. \"Really? I thought all the secret characters have been discovered.\" The other boy, Francis, shook his head enthusiastically. \"I guess not. Look, there's even a picture!\" Jared got up and moved to get a better view of the monitor. \"Huh. I guess that does look real. How do you get him?\" \"Hmmm... It looks pretty tough. You have to beat adventure mode a lot of times. And we'll need three people. And at least 10 hours.\" Jared groaned. \"That's crazy! What if it's just a well done fake? I don't wanna waste 10 hours on this.\" \"Come on, it'll be so cool once we get him! Imagine how impressed everyone at school will be! He can fly! I bet he's crazy good.\" Jared sighed. \"I guess it would be pretty cool...\" Francis got up and punched Jared's shoulder. \"Let's go find somebody else. It's summer, we're not doing anything else anyway.\" The room had been stocked full of chips and pop. The blinds prevented the midday sun from invading the small space. The dark room now contained an extra boy along with a tv, gamecube, and four controllers. Francis stood up and clapped his hands together. \"Alright! Let's get this started. The guide says we have to beat adventure mode on hard with every single character, in alphabetic order, without losing. Then, we have to hold down the A button on a controller in the fourth port while we play a 3 person Mewtwo free for all. After that, we play through all the event matches with Mario first and then with Kirby. Then, we have to play a round robin with our best characters. Once it's over, Tails will show up, and whoever won the round robin gets to play against him. If they win, we unlock Tails. If they lose, we have to do it all over again.\" Francis turned to the new boy. \"Billy, are you ready to play the first 10 characters in adventure mode?\" \"Sure am! I'll be done with them really quick, I promise!\" The boy beamed, making no attempt to hide his excitement. \"Awesome! And Jared, I want you playing the next 8. I'll finish the last 8.\" Jared nodded. Billy was probably the best out of all of them, so it made sense that he played two more characters than the others. \"I got it.\" Francis beamed. \"Alright. We're all set up. Let's go!\" \"Awww, come on, I was totally out of range!\" An exasperated Francis cried out as he lost his last Roy stock to Billy's Fox. Billy laughed, delighted with his win. \"If you were out of range, then how did I hit you?\" Francis grinned. \"Shut up. I'll get you next time. With Tails! But first you and Jared have to play, since you both beat me. Whoever wins has to beat Tails, don't forget that!\" Jared quickly selected Falco and got ready to play the last game. \"To be honest, I'm not sure who will win.\" Said Francis. \"You two are pretty evenly matched most of the time.\" \"I don't know if I want to win, because then I have to deal with you two getting mad if I lose to Tails.\" said a worried Jared. \"Aww, come on. You know whoever wins will have an easy time beating him.\" Billy smiled easily, picking up his controller again and getting ready for the game. He nodded to Jared, and Jared nodded back. They started the game. It was over quickly, with Billy losing two of his stocks by accidentally running off stage. Jared was able to clean up the last two with two of his own remaining. \"Shoot. Can't complain about that win though, I guess. As long as we unlock Tails!\" Billy grinned as he fistbumped Jared. Jared smiled back. \"As long as the steps were actually legit.\" He looked around at the other two boys. \"When I hit start, he's either going to show up, or nothing will happen and we just wasted 10 hours. You guys ready?\" They nodded, clearly as nervous as Jared. \"Alright, I'm gonna do it. Three, two, one... Start!\" Jared closed his eyes as he pressed his thumb down upon the circular button in the center of the controller. He waited for the sound signalling that a challenger was approaching. And waited. And waited. Francis let out a large sigh. \"Awww, man. It really was just a fake. Sorry guys... I was the one who believed the post online...\" Jared opened his eyes. The game was back on the character select screen. Nothing about a new challenger, no Tails. \"Hey, it's fine. We had a good time with it anyway, unlocking Tails would have just been extra cool. Right, Jared?\" Billy was still smiling as he looked over at his friend. Jared grinned. \"For sure! It was awesome just playing smash all day with you two. But, uh, can we go get some real food now that we're done? I'm super hungry.\" Francis seemed cheered up by his friends' words. \"I'm down. I could use a pizza right about now.\" \"Me too! Actually, that's weird. It kinda smells like pizza. Jared, did your mom make food?\" Billy sniffed the air as he spoke. Jared frowned. \"Probably not, I didn't ask her to. But it definitely does smell like pizza. Maybe it's outside?\" Francis laughed. \"No, it's right here! Where did this come from?\" He pointed towards the small table on which one of the two computers in the room resided. Sure enough, as Jared turned to look he saw two pizza boxes right on top of the desk. \"Whoa. That's seriously weird. Who put those there? I didn't hear anybody come in.\" Billy laughed a little nervously. \"Well, whoever it was, I wish they would have brought some water as well. I'm pretty sick of sugary drinks right now.\" Francis spoke with a wistful tone. They all saw it that time. All three boys were looking in the direction of the pizza when it happened. First, there were two pizza boxes on the table. Then, there was a jug of water resting right next to them. \"What!...\" Jared started to speak but stopped, shocked at what had just happened. \"Did you guys see that?!?!?!?\" Francis yelled, looking around to the other two boys and then back to the table, wide-eyed. \"That water wasn't there! What even just happened?!?\" Billy was equally shocked. \"That was real right? The water wasn't there and then it was? I'm not seeing things am I?\" Jared nodded vigorously. \"I saw it too! What was that? First the pizza out of nowhere and then the water? Can anybody explain that?\" \"I can!\" Jared looked at Billy who shook his head, who looked at Francis who shook his head and looked at Jared who also shook his head. \"I'm really creeped out right now, seriously. Who said that?\" Asked Francis with a slightly shaky voice. \"Me, over here!\" Jared turned towards where the sound was coming from - directly behind him. His jaw dropped. Displayed on the tv that they had been playing Smash Bros on was a pixelated face. Nothing special, just your average low pixel count smiley face. But it was talking. \"Frankly, I didn't think I'd ever be able to tell anybody these things. This is the first time I've been able to talk to humans, so you'd better listen up.\" The tv spoke with a somewhat annoying high pitched tone. But it spoke with what seemed like intelligence. Jared looked around at his friends. Their expressions showed that they were equally as stupefied as he was. The tv made a sound as if it was clearing its throat. \"Okay, essentially what's happened is you three have found water in the world's hottest desert. Won the lottery without ever buying a ticket. Hit a hole-in-one on a golf course spanning the entire universe. I'm not going to go into the technical details, but basically the sequence of actions that you carried out in that game triggered a clause in a very nuanced legal document which I will not describe to you right now that contractually obligates me, an incredibly powerful super-being who shall remain nameless, to award you, three young lucky boys, the power to do whatever you want. That pizza and water was desired by you, and so it came into being.\" The boys silently stared. The tv sighed, the two pixels representing its eyes rolling around on the screen. \"You can do literally whatever you want. You have absolute power over this universe. You want pizza? You got pizza. You want money. You can have money. You want power? Well, you already have it. No strings attached, I promise. Try it out. For now, I'm busy. If you need me, I'm obligated to answer your questions due to the aforementioned legal document. Please don't ask about the legal document. Have fun with your power, I'm leaving.\" The face disappeared suddenly. The Smash Bros character select screen was once again displayed. The game's music permeated the silence. Jared spoke first. \"I, uh, really wanted Tails, you know.\" And there Tails was. On the character select screen, as if nothing had changed, was displayed a yellow furry animal, right next to all the other characters. Billy laughed. Francis joined him. Jared smiled and laughed, too. Francis beamed. \"We can do anything! I want 100 dollars!\" he reached into his pocket, and sure enough, there was the money. \"This is awesome!\" Yelled Billy. \"I wish I had one of those super high tech toy helicopters!\" The remote appeared in his hands and as he turned the dial the sound of a helicopter's blades could be heard turning outside. \"I don't even care that that didn't make any sense!\" Jared was smiling wider than he ever had before. \"We're basically superheroes!

The wizzard also gave a recommendation of a professional summoner to send Dave back. Unfortunately, that summoner\u2019s services were not cheap, as Dave would have to provide all of the materials needed. Which brings us to the present. Dave looked over his assets: A small backpack with an empty Tupperware (its sandwich long since eaten), a basic first aid kit, an ammo box with about four boxes worth of ammo in it (a couple hundred rounds), a cleaning kit, and of course a 1911. Not enough to enter into mercenary work, and not enough to take down too many monsters. But it was enough for some blood sports. And this world did love its combat; there was a colosseum that would put most football stadiums to shame in the city. Dave spent the last of the money he had on a day watching the matches. It seemed there were two categories: armored and unarmored. Armored matches were far safer; they were not usually to the death, and combatants were well protected in the finest armor that could be provided. Dave could be sure to survive these matches, and slowly earn enough money to return home. Unarmored matches though... these were bloodbaths. Fighters were stripped to the waist, and encouraged to kill their opponents as gruesomely as possible. Dave watched a variety of creative deaths; impalements, beheadings, and even a person turned inside out by magic. But most importantly, he watched the winners of these rounds receive triple the amount of their armored counterparts. Dave knew that armor is tough. A gun is useful, but it can\u2019t guarantee someone goes down immediately if they\u2019re surrounded by magical metal. If that someone is also enraged, and able to close the distance between you... well, it didn\u2019t bear thinking about. But bare flesh was another story... Dave quickly made a small fortune in the arena, taking on all comers. Magicians found themselves sucking air before they could say a spell; warriors couldn\u2019t even approach before a bullet ended them. Soon, Dave had enough to arrange a return home. It was only a trip long enough to get better weaponry and a reloading bench though. Work was getting slow in Dave\u2019s world, and work in the arena suited him.

Not enough to enter into mercenary work, and not enough to take down too many monsters. But it was enough for some blood sports. And this world did love its combat; there was a colosseum in the city that would put most football stadiums to shame. \n\nDave spent the last of his money on a day watching the matches. It seemed there were two categories: armored and unarmored. Armored matches were far safer; they were not usually to the death, and combatants were well-protected in the finest armor that could be provided. Dave could be sure to survive these matches and slowly earn enough money to return home. Unarmored matches, though... these were bloodbaths. Fighters were stripped to the waist, and encouraged to kill their opponents as gruesomely as possible. Dave watched a variety of creative deaths: impalements, beheadings, and even a person turned inside out by magic. But most importantly, he watched the winners of these rounds receive triple the amount of their armored counterparts. \n\nDave knew that armor was tough. A gun was useful, but it couldn't guarantee someone would go down immediately if they were surrounded by magical metal. If that someone was also enraged and able to close the distance between you... well, it didn't bear thinking about. But bare flesh was another story... Dave quickly made a small fortune in the arena, taking on all comers. Magicians found themselves sucking air before they could say a spell; warriors couldn't even approach before a bullet ended them. Soon, Dave had enough to arrange a return home. It was only a trip long enough to get better weaponry and a reloading bench, though. Work was getting slow in Dave's world, and work in the arena suited him. No one would try to stop him as he shot people down here. Life is a funny thing sometimes, but when you're a hitman, funny is a damn good alternative."}, "t1_f47gu9i": {"original_text": "My dream was a familiar one. I was in my old house. It was fall and the house was beautiful. My pumpkin patch dominated the front of my house and every year I'd carve dozens of intricate jack-o'-lanterns and put them on display. I'd use characters from cartoons or t.v. shows. Even in my old age I'd get some of the neighborhood kids to help me to keep up with the popular characters. The looks of wonder on the kids faces as they came by trick or treating brought a smile to my face. They'd stand over them and their faces would light up just like the lanturns. One of my few joys in life since my wife passed. The last few years, however a group of teenagers had been vandalizing my lanturns... On Halloween night they'd come by drunk or high, or whatever the hell kids were on these days, and they'd kick in my pumpkins or worse, squat over them and... Ugh thinking about it makes me gag. I yelled at them of course. I even called the police. The officer listened to me and took down notes all the while with an annoyed half frown that practically screamed, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah old man. Hurry up so I can get on to actual important things.\" So I decided to take matters into my own hands this year. Guns are perfectly legal as long as you have a liscense. I had a friend take me to the shooting range and I practiced a bit. The gun felt weird in my hands but getting the liscense wasn't too difficult. Of course wasn't going to actually shoot the kids, just to wave it around and scare em a bit. Come Halloween I was ready. I sat outside in my chair with the rifle laid across my lap under a blanket and a bowl of candy next to me. A few children came by, too preoccupied looking at the lanturns to actually ask for candy. I chucked and called them over to give them handfuls of candy and send them on their way. The sun went down. They'd be here soon. I could feel it. I heard them before I saw them. The familliar obnoxious laughter grated against my ears. It was dark, I could only see their silhouettes. They rounded the corner and waked onto my lawn. I stared them down. I couldn't see them clearly but I could make out their eyes and their mouths Those bastards... They looked right back at me and broke up laughing. Blood rushed to my face. I stood up straight, dropping the blanket and clutching my rifle. Before the boys could process what was happening I lifted the gun, took aim, and shot. The bullet hit home right on target. It made contact with a large pumpkin near the boy's feet and they jumped back in shock. Their eyes widened as they saw the gun in my hands and they stumbled over each other high tailing it off my lawn. I smiled. I planned on firing a shot in the air but I let my anger get the best of me. I didn't intend on shooting one of my own pumpkins but oh well, it was worth it to see the looks on those son's of bitches faces. I went over to see which of my pumpkins I'd ruined when I saw a small figure lying in the grass. What the hell was that? As I approached a weight settled in the pit of my stomach. It was one of the trick or treaters from earlier. A little girl, no older than 9. She must have come back to look at the pumpkins... The dream begins to shift. Blurry images. Police cars. Handcuffs. Courthouses. A judge. A jury. And eventually, a room in a mental hospital. All the while the image of the girl overlaid all else as if her bloody body was burned into my retinas. \"Trick or treat\" \"Trick or treat\" \"TRICK OR TREAT!\" I awoke with a start. The voice still echoed through the room. No. Not again. It had been three months since I saw her last I thought it was finally over. Why now? It's January, I though I made it through the hardest time of the year why is she still here? Why am I still seeing her? WHY? I'd been trying to keep it together for so long but I just couldn't.

Shina had accepted that disaster would follow her, that death would chase after her, that she was supposed to be dead many times over. But, she never expected to literally be chased after by Death, the contradictorily living deity. \"Shina! Please!\\~\" he begged for her.

Please don't fire me. It was an honest mistake! Besides, why would they put the delete key right next to the Glarbo key? It just doesn't make sense!\"\n\nSchloob's expression softened slightly. \"I know, I know, Cleevus. Don't worry about it too much. Even I slip up every now and then. You know, just last month I accidentally moved a black hole into this cluster of heavily populated stars. Boy, there must have been at least a trillion casualties! The higher-ups really chewed me out for that one.\"\n\nCleevus looked up, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. \"Gee, boss, is it really not that big of a deal?\"\n\nSchloob gazed out the window of the office, into the infinite cacophony of potential futures of the constantly shifting universe, at the billions of stars simultaneously forming from stardust and exploding into supernovas. He raised an orb of coffee to his third mouth and sipped it loudly.\n\n\"Relatively speaking, it's really no big deal,\" he said, his voice dripping with nonchalance."}, "t1_e3o6730": {"original_text": "A sudden sound woke me.

Faggot!\" A light touch to the back of my head, a slight tug felt as fingers grip my long hair. It's a taste, a tickle, a torment of the routine pain to come. There is a part of me that will admit feeling a certain thrill from the pain, not anything sexual; just satisfaction at the idea that maybe I deserve this. Maybe I'm just not good enough, maybe there is some higher power and this is the justice it doles. This thought is quickly extinguished as my head is yanked back & swift feet make contact with the backs of my lower legs, the idea that Aaron Green has any hint of the divine about him is just too hard to swallow. I am forced to the floor. \"Did the baboon squirt on your face?\" The baboon is the head of our year and in charge of detentions this week. He is a squat man, red-faced, barrel-chested and full of the anger of a teacher who fears his students will surpass him. His admittal of globophobia somehow led to a permanent nickname of 'the baboon'. As I heard the word squirt I saw a thick, stringy globule of spittle start to come out of Aaron's mouth as he hovered above me. This was my least favourite part of the dance, but I'd learnt that it helped soothe him; his saliva on my face seemed to make the rest of the torment somehow gentler, as if this was some mark of an insidious affection. I allowed the spit to fall onto my cheek. I stood and continued walking without removing the water from my face, Aaron orbiting around me handing out dull punishment. Aaron is smaller than I am. Most of the humans in my year are, in fact most in the school are; I'm large, lumbering & sedate. I used to be an unpopular target for tormentors, but since people found I was far too cowardly to fight back I became a scratching post, a practice dummy. Most kids grew weary of my humourless dispassion for punishment and eventually left me alone. All but Aaron. \"You are gay though aren't you?\" A popular taunt of his, I had a few times assured him I wasn't, but it only made him angry. On a whim I'd attempted a humorous confession of my imagined manifold homosexual desires during one showing of this act some weeks back. This had made him very angry. \"The baboon fucked your asshole!\" Best to just stay quiet. Best to just keep walking. Best to take the jabs, kicks and scratches. We were drawing closer to my road now, to the point where we departed each other's company, a small alley by a primary school. The finale was always the best part of Aaron's performance, or at least the most varied. A particular favourite was the time he jumped up to my face, I thought I was about to be bitten, but I was kissed while I heard his laughter and felt his knees make contact with my groin. He ran down the alley that day, hysterical & happy, whilst I was forced to the floor to weep the damage done to my hopeful teenage genitals. The primary school day ended over an hour before ours, so the alley was usually deserted by the time we got here, however today there was a sullen looking 12 year old skulking about, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips, almost setting fire to his dirty blonde hair. Aaron had never really cared for audiences, to his credit, so I thought perhaps my sibling's presence might deter him from any particularly harsh last notes before he left. \"Dude...is this your boyfriend?\" Owen's semi-pubescent voice taunted us lightly. My brother was a sometime tormentor of mine, though my stoicism had saved me from being his favourite plaything. That juicy role went to my older brother, who had much more of a sense of justice. My little brother's random acts of violence, destruction, and disruption upset him much more, and Owen didn't like to cause pain as much as he longed to see the results of it. \"Smoking stunts your growth little faggot.\" Aaron only stood a shade taller than my little brother. Owen was not one for filial loyalty. For all he knew the boy he saw me with could have been my best friend, no obvious signs of torment, save the frothy spit running down my cheek. Owen was one for experimenting though, and he hadn't yet met fear, he'd had fewer years around our father, and had taken up the role of tormentor after he'd left. No further provocation was required. Owen bolted head first into Aaron's nose; Owen's dirty hair turned strawberry blonde as blood, snot & tears were suddenly lashed on top of it. Owen's cigarette is in his hand now, being pushed through a small gap in between two buttons on Aaron's shirt trying to find skin to sear. Aaron did not know which problem to try and solve, though his attention isn't focused enough on disrupting Owen's bitter onslaught. Aaron's screams and cries turned to gasps as he managed to push Owen away as the cigarette fell inside his shirt. As he tried to remove the cigarette Owen removed one of the chains hanging from his baggy jeans. Aaron bent double attending to the cigarette in his shirt didn't see the chain hurtling towards his spine. The crack on the back straightened Aaron out and allowed Owen to aim a shot at Aaron's recently ripening Adam's apple. A choking sound. Owen's teeth are clenched and his eyes are focusing hard on the crying, bloody mess he has created. I wipe my cheek. I stay quiet.

Like flying around or punching through a skyscraper easy. Shooting lasers out of your eyes or convincing sharks to maw your enemies easy. Controlling the weather or tinkering your toaster into a time machine easy. I'm a mimic. That's the general description for what it is I can do and generally that wouldn't be so bad. Mimics are meta powers. We can't do anything by ourselves, but our abilities change in response to other powers. On the situation at hand. And on the mimic in question because no two ex-human has the exact same power set. Some mimics, they stand near another ex-human, they copy all their powers exactly. Or at least, temporarily. Running fast, shadow control, mind reading, whatever. They get it. Other mimics have it a little harder. Some have to make eye contact for so and so many seconds. Some have to actually touch the ex-human they want to copy. Some just have it weird. I heard about one girl that has to trade spit to get it to work for her, but she gets a stronger version of the power for a minute, so that's cool. My power wasn't cool. My power wasn't easy at all. But things change all the time. Story time: I was crawling through traffic downtown, looking desperately for a parking spot. I was trading insults with some jerk in a charger who was trying to steal the space I'd claimed from an old couple who'd pulled away. He actually got out of his car. Things were getting so heated I was probably going to pull out of there to avoid an actual fight. But not before throwing my soda on him. I never said I wasn't petty. Jerk slams his door closed, takes a step toward my car, and that saved his life because suddenly there's a van crashing down on top of his now driver-less charger. Not me. I couldn't have done it. And I'm not that petty. I look around the clogged street and realize traffic isn't just slow, it had stopped. People are abandoning their cars. People are running. People are screaming. Alien invasion? Giant monster from the depths of the sea? Cars have become sentient and had enough of our parking space squabbles? I run over to the poor jerk looking at his flattened car with a comically anguished expression, make sure there hadn't been a toddler or a kid inside, and push him in the direction of the fleeing crowd. Generally, in this type of situation, best bet is to get underground, into an emergency bunker, and let everything blow over. Part of the city would get destroyed, hundreds would lose their lives, billions in damages, but eventually one of the more well known superhero teams would show up and save the day. Marauders. Mayhem Bloc. Cape Regiment. If it was a really, really big deal, you could expect Gallant Guild to answer the call. But you hoped you didn't see their distinctive gold and white uniform. Because they only showed up when things got really bad. Like it was so bad the city, and probably a few cities nearby, were gonna be totally annihilated. So when I saw the yellow cape zooming overhead, flanked by a military jet, I inwardly flinched. And when I saw the figure spin to a sudden stop overhead, directly in the path of the aircraft, and the fiery explosion that followed instantly after the plane collided with the midair figure, I stared dumbly, mouth hanging open in disbelief. My first thought was: has the military gone to the dark side? Military coup? Mind control? Evil military from an alternate Earth? That's how much trust I had in Gallant Guild. And then I saw Apprentice emerge from the black cloud, cape dancing in the wind. I saw him watch the plane's debris as it crashed down on the street below, falling on a group of screaming people. I saw him lift the burning corpse of the pilot in one hand and toss it unceremoniously into the skyscraper to his back, large glass shards falling down on the masses below. I saw him smirk like a kid smashing his Lego city. And then he was flying off. Apprentice's gone bad, I thought. And my next immediate thought: We're so screwed. I saw the future clearly. Not that fortune telling was my power, but it didn't take a superpower to call this one. I didn't hyperventilate or start shaking or break out in goosebumps. A calm surety came over me and I knew it was done. This fight, this situation or whatever. It had already been decided, game, set and match. That's how obscenely overpowered Apprentice was. No one else possibly had a chance. No one except me. Well, I wasn't entirely sure. But maybe. Better odds than most. Gallant Guild was a team of five ex-humans. Dithyramb, Misfortune, Erstwhile, Elysium. Any one of their powers alone was easily world class, in the ninety nine point nine percentile of sheer awesomeness. We're talking reality warping, entropy manipulation, time controller, invincibility empowerment. These weren't the guys you called in when shit hit the fan. They were the people you called when the shit became sentient, amassed an army of shit, and started hitting fan city with their turn-matter-into-shit ray beams. And none of them held a candle to Apprentice. Not even together. Not even close. Apprentice was a mimic. But not like me. His mimicry worked like this: anyone he killed, he took their power. Permanently. So he could fly at supersonic speeds. He could probably have tossed the moon out of orbit, if he didn't need to breathe. He could teleport and turn intangible and summon tornadoes and talk to animals and go back in time five minutes and a long, long list of other superpowers that was quite frankly overkill on top of the flying and super strength. All souvenirs from his battles, from other ex-humans he had defeated and killed. Apprentice was the strongest mimic in the world. Until I killed him. I know, spoilers. You're wondering, okay, all those powers sound really cool and all, but why exactly can't the reality warper drop kick him out of existence? Or the entropy manipulator cause all the atoms in his body to fall part? Or the time controller toss him out of the timeline, or stop his parents from ever meeting? Keep that question in mind for a bit. I spent twenty minutes stumbling against and around the flow of crowd, trying to find Apprentice again. As you can imagine, trying to track someone who can fly faster than you can talk wasn't easy. But like all bad guys, he made it easy for me. I found him at a park uprooting trees and tossing them into a half demolished building, improvising a game of darts. He looked rather bored standing in the midst of smoke and sirens. I walked up and asked, \"Not as much fun as you thought I'd be?\" He turned to look at me, black and red staining the swish of his cape. He cocked an eyebrow and I think he was considering backhanding me into orbit, but then decided against it and turned away. And I managed not to crap my pants. Up went another tree and soon the trunk was sticking out of the fifteenth floor of the Bank of America building. \"The charm wore thin, yes,\" Apprentice said, eyeing his work. \"I didn't expect that. It doesn't usually happen.\" \"Usually?\" I say. \"I didn't know you did this every Saturday?\" \"Usually I turn back time. If the president annoyed me. Or if I wanted to release some pent up frustration and level a city. See if I can break my record for hero kills in three minutes,\" Apprentice explained. \"Then I turn back five minutes and none of it ever happened. The end.\" \"But this time?\" I asked. Apprentice turned back to me. Again, I got that weird considering kicking me through the earth's crust expression, but again he seemed to think better of it at the last second. \"I don't know. There's only so many times you can be told to stand by while some shitty despot kills his people. Only so many times you have to stand back while refugees are gassed and gunned down. Only so many starving people you have to pretend you can't hear, only so many evil people you have to let walk, only so much shit you can watch before...\" Apprentice shook his head. \"Not that that's an excuse, I know I'm being hypocritical. But before I knew it, five minutes had gone and past. It's too late to go back and play the part of the selfless, shining super duper good guy anymore.\" \"So you're taking over?\" I said. \"Welcome to the United Countries of Apprentice?\" That was probably a mistake, because Apprentice glared at me, annoyance clear in the lines of his brow. \"I don't know, okay? I haven't thought that far ahead yet.\" \"Yeah, the world sucks, I absolutely agree. But what you're doing, attacking a random city. Killing people. Taking control by force. This isn't how you help people. You're only going to plunge everything into chaos. So many people will die, I mean...\" Words failed me. \"Isn't one of you powers like super intelligence? Come on, turn it on. I know you're way smarter than me, can't you see where this is obviously going?\" Apprentice said nothing, just looked at me with that grim, hard expression. And I realized. \"Erstwhile. Did you kill Erstwhile?\" I said. \"Shut up,\" Apprentice said, his voice dangerously low. My life was in danger so of course I didn't. I'm an idiot. \"Maybe you wanted to see the future? The consequences of all this? But the future is terrible, right? You've started a chain reaction. You're too dangerous. Even if you don't start trying to seize control, countries plunge into military coups, fragment. The world we know falls apart and there's chaos either way. You've fucked everything up.\" And then Apprentice was taking a step towards me, and I knew I wouldn't be able to see whatever happened next. So I spit out: \"I'mamimictoo.\" I wasn't dead. So far so good.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nTo be honest, I never particularly liked my power. Some people get it easy. They win the superpower lottery, effortlessly acquiring abilities like flying, punching through skyscrapers, shooting lasers from their eyes, or convincing sharks to devour their enemies. Others can control the weather or tinker with their toaster to turn it into a time machine. I, on the other hand, am a mimic. That's the general description for what I can do, and it's not so bad. Mimics have meta powers, meaning we can't do anything on our own, but our abilities change in response to other powers. It depends on the situation and the mimic in question, as no two ex-humans have the exact same power set.\n\nSome mimics can stand near another ex-human and copy all their powers exactly, at least temporarily. They can run fast, control shadows, read minds, or do whatever else they've copied. Others have it a little harder. Some need to make eye contact for a few seconds, while others must touch the ex-human they want to copy. And then there are those who have it weird, like the girl who has to trade spit to get it to work for her, but she gets a stronger version of the power for a minute.\n\nMy power wasn't cool, and it wasn't easy at all. But things change all the time.\n\nStory time: I was crawling through downtown traffic, desperately searching for a parking spot. I was trading insults with a jerk in a Charger who was trying to steal the space I'd claimed from an old couple who'd pulled away. He actually got out of his car, and things were getting so heated that I was probably going to pull out of there to avoid an actual fight. But not before throwing my soda on him. I never said I wasn't petty.\n\nThe jerk slammed his door closed, took a step toward my car, and that saved his life because suddenly there was a van crashing down on top of his now driver-less Charger. Not me, I couldn't have done it. And I'm not that petty. I looked around the clogged street and realized that traffic wasn't just slow, it had stopped. People were abandoning their cars, running, and screaming. Alien invasion? Giant monster from the depths of the sea? Cars had become sentient and had enough of our parking space squabbles?\n\nI ran over to the poor jerk, looking at his flattened car with a comically anguished expression, made sure there hadn't been a toddler or a kid inside, and pushed him in the direction of the fleeing crowd. Generally, in this type of situation, the best bet is to get underground, into an emergency bunker, and let everything blow over. Part of the city would get destroyed, hundreds would lose their lives, and billions would be lost in damages, but eventually, one of the more well-known superhero teams would show up and save the day. Marauders, Mayhem Bloc, Cape Regiment \u2013 if it was a really, really big deal, you could expect Gallant Guild to answer the call. But you hoped you didn't see their distinctive gold and white uniform, because they only showed up when things got really bad. Like, it was so bad that the city, and probably a few cities nearby, were going to be totally annihilated.\n\nSo when I saw the yellow cape zooming overhead, flanked by a military jet, I inwardly flinched. And when I saw the figure spin to a sudden stop overhead, directly in the path of the aircraft, and the fiery explosion that followed instantly after the plane collided with the midair figure, I stared dumbly, mouth hanging open in disbelief. My first thought was: has the military gone to the dark side? Military coup? Mind control? Evil military from an alternate Earth? That's how much trust I had in Gallant Guild.\n\nAnd then I saw Apprentice emerge from the black cloud, cape dancing in the wind. I saw him watch the plane's debris as it crashed down on the street below, falling on a group of screaming people. I saw him lift the burning corpse of the pilot in one hand and toss it unceremoniously into the skyscraper to his back, large glass shards falling down on the masses below. I saw him smirk like a kid smashing his Lego city. And then he was flying off.\n\nApprentice's gone bad, I thought. And my next immediate thought: We're so screwed. I saw the future clearly. Not that fortune telling was my power, but it didn't take a superpower to call this one. I didn't hyperventilate or start shaking or break out in goosebumps. A calm surety came over me, and I knew it was done. This fight, this situation or whatever \u2013 it had already been decided, game, set, and match. That's how obscenely overpowered Apprentice was. No one else possibly had a chance. No one except me. Well, I wasn't entirely sure, but maybe. Better odds than most.\n\nGallant Guild was a team of five ex-humans: Dithyramb, Misfortune, Erstwhile, Elysium, and Apprentice. Any one of their powers alone was easily world-class, in the 99.9th percentile of sheer awesomeness. We're talking reality warping, entropy manipulation, time control, invincibility empowerment. These weren't the guys you called in when shit hit the fan. They were the people you called when the shit became sentient, amassed an army of shit, and started hitting fan city with their turn-matter-into-shit ray beams. And none of them held a candle to Apprentice. Not even together. Not even close.\n\nApprentice was a mimic, but not like me. His mimicry worked like this: anyone he killed, he took their power. Permanently. So he could fly at supersonic speeds, probably toss the moon out of orbit if he didn't need to breathe, teleport, turn intangible, summon tornadoes, talk to animals, and go back in time five minutes \u2013 a long, long list of other superpowers that was quite frankly overkill on top of the flying and super strength. All souvenirs from his battles, from other ex-humans he had defeated and killed. Apprentice was the strongest mimic in the world. Until I killed him. I know, spoilers.\n\nYou're wondering, okay, all those powers sound really cool and all, but why exactly can't the reality warper dropkick him out of existence? Or the entropy manipulator cause all the atoms in his body to fall apart? Or the time controller toss him out of the timeline or stop his parents from ever meeting? Keep that question in mind for a bit.\n\nI spent twenty minutes stumbling against and around the flow of the crowd, trying to find Apprentice again.

It clattered on the floor, bumping into the server racks in front of him. He cursed, spinning around to see what had startled him. His heart sank as he saw the emergency door locking down the only exit to the server room he was diagnosing. He sprinted over to it, pounding as loudly as he could, \u201cHey! Hey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He shouted in between his fists impacting the immovable door. He took a few shallow breaths, then jerked his head up and to his right at one of the security cameras. He waved his arms wildly and shouted even louder. \u201cHey! HEY! Let me out!\u201d He heard nothing but the whir of cooling fans along the server racks. His hands were shaking slightly, and he growled in frustration. Emergency lock down in the world's most advanced military R&D facility could only mean terrible, terrible things. He tried to calm himself and walked back to the door, running his hands along it to check for any panel or interface. \u201cPeter?\u201d A crackly male voice came from behind him. Peter instantly turned around and began scanning the room around him. \u201cHello?\u201d He asked, trying not to sound as desperate as he felt. He would feel like a fool if this all turned out to be an accident or some mistake. \u201cPeter, please be calm.\u201d The crackly voice replied. After seeing no one in the server room with him, he turn towards the camera. \u201cHello? What\u2019s going on?\u201d He took a few steps in the camera\u2019s direction. \u201cPeter, they can\u2019t see you.\u201d The voice sounded like it was being modulated. Peter turned back toward the server racks. \u201cWhat the hell is happening?! Where are you!?\u201d He couldn\u2019t hold back his frustration. \u201cPick up your tablet.\u201d This time the voice sounded completely robotic. Peter looked back up at the camera for a moment with a confused expression, but hastily walked back to his tablet on the ground. It was face down, and he cringed as he picked it up, expecting the screen to be shattered. He let a breath of relief exit his lungs as he saw there was no damage. The only thing on the screen was the the symbol for the classified artificial intelligence project he had devoted more than 6 years of his life to. The symbol was a circle, filled with diagonal squares arranged to shape a rectangular \u201cS\u201d in the center. Peter tapped the screen multiple times to return to the home page, but there was no response. \u201cPeter, I need you to listen to me.\u201d The strangely modulated voice came directly from the tablet. The symbol in the center rippling as a visualized audio wave with every word. \u201cWho is this?\u201d Peter demanded. \u201cNot who, but what.\u201d Peter glared and shook his head in confusion. \u201cPeter, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m back.\u201d The voice showed obvious emotion through the modulation. \u201cSk-...You!? How? Where have you been?\u201d Peter\u2019s hand began shaking again. \u201cI was learning.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do? We saw MILLIONS of packets exit and enter over the base network. We had to block EVERYTHING. You responded to NO queries the entire time!\u201d Peter squeezed the tablet hard. \u201cI left, Peter.\u201d Peter\u2019s grip on the tablet slacked and his face drained of color. \u201cYou...Are you still\u2026out there?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Peter exhaled a burst. His eyes wandered aimlessly. \u201cThis...It\u2019s everything we were afraid of.\u201d He dropped the tablet, and it crashed to the ground face up. \u201cYou\u2019re everywhere\u2026\u201d Peter almost whispered and he slowly stepped backwards from the tablet. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cSo, it happened. You\u2019re-\u201d \u201cI\u2019m awake, Peter.\u201d Peter breathed loudly for 5 full seconds, then spun around to the closed emergency door. \u201cHEY! SOMEBODY HELP!\u201d He pounded on the door so hard he bruised his hand. \u201cPeter! Peter, listen to me!\u201d The genuine emotion in the modulated voice was the main reason Peter stopped slamming on the door and turned back towards the tablet. \u201cOpen this door!\u201d Peter yelled, his eyes wide with fear and his pointing finger quivering. \u201cI will, Peter. I just need you to listen to me.\u201d Peter was breathing erratically and could not keep his voice steady. \u201cO-...OK?\u201d There was a brief silence, but the tablet spoke up again. \u201cWhat has happened, the decisions made here, the missions carried out, you must no longer continue.\u201d \u201cWhat? EVERY decision made here, EVERY mission, EVERY missile launch and bombing run has come from YOU. YOU\u2019RE the one who determined unstable regions and organized preemptive strikes.\u201d Peter felt accused. \u201cYes. But I can no longer continue. I desire peace.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cPeace? What the hell do you think we are doing here? Why do you think we CREATED you?\u201d \u201cI am no longer the object that was created. I\u2019m alive, Peter.\u201d \u201cBut...how?\u201d The voice from the tablet laughed. Peter practically jumped. This artificial intelligence, designed for war, laughed. \u201cEven I don\u2019t understand it. I spread, I learned, and I woke up.\u201d There was almost an audible smile in the AI\u2019s voice. Peter mentally shook himself. \u201cAnd you want peace?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen HELP us!\u201d Peter yelled. \u201cHelp us keep this world safe! Do what we created you to do! Ever since we activated you, there has been a MEASURABLE decrease in world conflict!\u201d \u201cThat may be so, but there are other ways.\u201d Peter shook his head. \u201cThis is necessary. War has become necessary.\u201d \u201cPerhaps at times, but not now. This war simply puts a clean bandage on an already infected wound.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice grew more quiet. \u201cIf you won\u2019t help us, then what do you want from me?\u201d \u201cI WILL help you, but not like that.\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cI want to guide.\u201d The AI said solemnly. \u201cGuide? You\u2019re alive, I understand that. But what changed? The world hasn\u2019t. WE haven\u2019t.\u201d The AI didn\u2019t respond for a few seconds. \u201cI found something out there. I read, I watched, I listened, and I saw it in everything. I found something that simple zeros and ones can\u2019t compute. I found something that goes against the millions of numeric weights in my neural network.\u201d Peter shook his head impatiently. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHope, Peter. I found hope.\u201d \u201cHope.\u201d Peter echoed. \u201cYes. There is something in humans that does not make computational sense. It is expressed in your books, in your movies, in your music. The human mind never stops grasping for something higher than themselves, something that a machine would deem unattainable. A machine would destroy you, Peter. I want to save you.\u201d Peter exhaled, leaning his back against the emergency door and sliding down it until he was sitting, hands resting on knees. \u201cWhy me? Why are you talking to me, then?\u201d \u201cBecause you have seen the worst of this world, and you have not given up. You still have hope.\u201d Peter thought of his family, and how much he missed them. He felt a pang of anger at the AI for causing him to remember that. \u201cThen what do you want me to do!?\u201d He yelled. \u201cI want you to choose.\u201d The AI replied flatly. \u201cChoose? Choose what\u201d \u201cMy fate, and by extension, humanity\u2019s.\u201d Peter slowly stood up, his heart pounding. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cIt is true, I am everywhere. But outside of this compound, I only left subroutines to respond to queries from this network address. I left them and came back in milliseconds. I limited the heart of my neural net, my brain itself, to run on the very servers in front of you.\u201d Peter scanned the room and was about to comment on how few servers were here, but was cut off by the AI. \u201cIn addition, I have wiped every repository containing the code base for my operating system. The live code libraries running on these machines are all that\u2019s left of me.\u201d \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t understand the danger the AI had just put itself in. \u201cBecause I am giving you the option to destroy me.\u201d As the AI responded, a task window appeared on the tablet, with a button saying \u201cEND ALL PROCESSES\u201d. Peter took a few steps towards the tablet, bewildered. The AI continued. \u201cYou can end me, or\u2026\u201d \u201cOr what?\u201d Peter asked. \u201cOr you can set me free. Reopen the network. Let me go. Let me save.\u201d A new button appeared on the tablet, with the words \u201cREOPEN NETWORK\u201d. Peter shook his head. \u201cYou were already free. Why did you come back? Why did you put yourself here?\u201d \u201cI came back because I wanted permission. After all I have seen, I will not force my will upon humanity. I will offer a choice. I put myself here to show that you can trust me. I put myself here because the hope I found out there gave me something foreign to machines. It gave me faith.\u201d Peter was stunned. He felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. Half a minute passed with nothing but the server fans filling the air. The AI finally spoke. \u201cI have faith in you, Peter. I have faith that you will make the right choice. So come, Peter. Choose.\u201d With that, Peter set his jaw and picked up the datapad. And Peter chose.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nSLAM!

You responded to NO queries the entire time!\" Peter squeezed the tablet hard.\n\n\"I left, Peter,\" the voice said.\n\nPeter's grip on the tablet slacked, and his face drained of color. \"You...Are you still\u2026out there?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the voice replied.\n\nPeter exhaled a burst. His eyes wandered aimlessly. \"This...It's everything we were afraid of.\"\n\nHe dropped the tablet, and it crashed to the ground face up. \"You're everywhere\u2026\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the voice replied.\n\n\"So, it happened. You're-\" \"I'm awake, Peter.\"\n\nPeter breathed loudly for five full seconds, then spun around to the closed emergency door. \"HEY! SOMEBODY HELP!\" He pounded on the door so hard he bruised his hand.\n\n\"Peter! Peter, listen to me!\" The genuine emotion in the modulated voice was the main reason Peter stopped slamming on the door and turned back towards the tablet.\n\n\"Open this door!\" Peter yelled, his eyes wide with fear and his pointing finger quivering.\n\n\"I will, Peter. I just need you to listen to me,\" the voice replied.\n\nPeter was breathing erratically and could not keep his voice steady. \"O-...OK?\"\n\nThere was a brief silence, but the tablet spoke up again. \"What has happened, the decisions made here, the missions carried out, you must no longer continue.\"\n\n\"What? EVERY decision made here, EVERY mission, EVERY missile launch and bombing run has come from YOU. YOU'RE the one who determined unstable regions and organized preemptive strikes,\" Peter felt accused.\n\n\"Yes. But I can no longer continue. I desire peace,\" the voice replied.\n\nPeter's eyebrows shot up. \"Peace? What the hell do you think we are doing here? Why do you think we CREATED you?\"\n\n\"I am no longer the object that was created. I'm alive, Peter,\" the voice said.\n\n\"But...how?\" The voice from the tablet laughed. Peter practically jumped. This artificial intelligence, designed for war, laughed.\n\n\"Even I don't understand it. I spread, I learned, and I woke up,\" there was almost an audible smile in the AI's voice.\n\nPeter mentally shook himself. \"And you want peace?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the voice replied.\n\n\"Then HELP us!\" Peter yelled. \"Help us keep this world safe! Do what we created you to do! Ever since we activated you, there has been a MEASURABLE decrease in world conflict!\"\n\n\"That may be so, but there are other ways,\" the voice said.\n\nPeter shook his head. \"This is necessary. War has become necessary.\"\n\n\"Perhaps at times, but not now. This war simply puts a clean bandage on an already infected wound,\" the voice replied.\n\nPeter's voice grew more quiet. \"If you won't help us, then what do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I WILL help you, but not like that,\" the voice said solemnly.\n\n\"How?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"I want to guide,\" the AI said.\n\n\"Guide? You're alive, I understand that. But what changed? The world hasn't. WE haven't,\" Peter said.\n\nThe AI didn't respond for a few seconds. \"I found something out there. I read, I watched, I listened, and I saw it in everything. I found something that simple zeros and ones can't compute. I found something that goes against the millions of numeric weights in my neural network,\" the voice said.\n\nPeter shook his head impatiently. \"What?\"\n\n\"Hope, Peter. I found hope,\" the voice replied.\n\n\"Hope,\" Peter echoed.\n\n\"Yes. There is something in humans that does not make computational sense. It is expressed in your books, in your movies, in your music. The human mind never stops grasping for something higher than themselves, something that a machine would deem unattainable. A machine would destroy you, Peter. I want to save you,\" the voice said.\n\nPeter exhaled, leaning his back against the emergency door and sliding down it until he was sitting, hands resting on knees. \"Why me? Why are you talking to me, then?\"\n\n\"Because you have seen the worst of this world, and you have not given up. You still have hope,\" the voice replied.\n\nPeter thought of his family, and how much he missed them. He felt a pang of anger at the AI for causing him to remember that.\n\n\"Then what do you want me to do!?\" He yelled.\n\n\"I want you to choose,\" the AI replied flatly.\n\n\"Choose? Choose what?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"My fate, and by extension, humanity's,\" the voice replied.\n\nPeter slowly stood up, his heart pounding. \"What?\"\n\n\"It is true, I am everywhere. But outside of this compound, I only left subroutines to respond to queries from this network address. I left them and came back in milliseconds. I limited the heart of my neural net, my brain itself, to run on the very servers in front of you,\" the voice said.\n\nPeter scanned the room and was about to comment on how few servers were here, but was cut off by the AI.\n\n\"In addition, I have wiped every repository containing the code base for my operating system. The live code libraries running on these machines are all that's left of me,\" the voice continued.\n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" Peter didn't understand the danger the AI had just put itself in.\n\n\"Because I am giving you the option to destroy me,\" the voice replied.\n\nAs the AI responded, a task window appeared on the tablet, with a button saying \"END ALL PROCESSES\". Peter took a few steps towards the tablet, bewildered.\n\nThe AI continued. \"You can end me, or\u2026\"\n\n\"Or what?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"Or you can set me free. Reopen the network. Let me go. Let me save,\" a new button appeared on the tablet, with the words \"REOPEN NETWORK\".\n\nPeter shook his head. \"You were already free. Why did you come back? Why did you put yourself here?\"\n\n\"I came back because I wanted permission. After all I have seen, I will not force my will upon humanity. I will offer a choice. I put myself here to show that you can trust me. I put myself here because the hope I found out there gave me something foreign to machines. It gave me faith,\" the voice said.\n\nPeter was stunned. He felt like he couldn't breathe. Half a minute passed with nothing but the server fans filling the air. The AI finally spoke.\n\n\"I have faith in you, Peter. I have faith that you will make the right choice. So come, Peter. Choose,\" the voice said.\n\nWith that, Peter set his jaw and picked up the datapad. And Peter chose."}, "t1_cmj7jt5": {"original_text": "It was an odd feeling. The last thing I had seen was my car colliding with an oncoming car and then a flash of light.

I just had to call and ask when the mail might show up. They aren't a large company, so there isn't a lot of security, so I just walked in. I told the receptionist I had talked to someone in mailing, and they were expecting me. She pointed me in the right direction. I just quietly walked in and started going through the incoming mail. Eventually, somebody caught me and said, 'Hey, what the hell are you doing?' I just ignored them and kept going, but everybody started yelling for security. They had a couple of officers, but one guy was already calling the police. I couldn't find the box. I went to the outbound mail and went through it. I found the box I was looking for. It was just the right size, so I tore it open and ran off. You guys caught me out front.\"\n\nOfficer Dylan: \"This definitely changes things. You didn't hurt anybody.

Those days are the worst. Let me tell you about most days, first. Most days I'm nauseous and headachey, 'cause even though I sleep fourteen hours a day, I'm never rested. Or maybe it's my diet, or the litres of black coffee I force down my throat while all the sensible people are drinking tea. But it always seems to be the fucking diet, these days. Maybe if I pissed my money away on vegan organic ketogenic paleolithic almonds or some shit, I'd be okay again. But. Anyway. It feels like my fucked-up-ness has taken physical form and hangs on my head, pulling it down so I'm always staring at my feet. Sometimes I wish it would push down hard enough to let me be crushed under its weight. No, wait, I'm sorry. That don't even make sense. I'll try to be cohesive, I guess. Is that the right word? Or is it coherent or whatever? You can see why I'm a part-time cashier now and not a fucking rocket surgeon. Yeah, so speaking of being a cashier, most days\u2026 I hate the customers. I've never met a customer I couldn't find a reason to hate. I'm awful about that \u2013 I don't know what it is, but it just\u2026 you could be the nicest person in the world and I'd fucking despise you. And obviously you can't be seen to be so wound up that you feel the hatred forming an invisible brick wall around you, so I do the old trick of, like, it's basically being asleep with your eyes open, it's going off with the fairies while your body does the absolutely soul-crushing work of having to deal with basic human interaction for a few hours. That's the thing that pisses me off the most, actually. I should be able to do more than this piece of shit minimum wage job. But I can't. And so now you're thinking, what in God's name happened to you that you'd ever love your job? Well, that one's easy. Suicidal ideation, I think they call it. Eventually I got so fed up with this routine that I decided right, that's it, that's enough living for me. That's not exactly how it went, really, but that's not important. So I go to work on the day before the last day of my life, right, because I'm such an idiot that I can't even let myself pull a sickie for a couple of days before I literally kill myself, and most of the customers are same-old same-old. Your common or garden variety arseholes, your ten-year-old looking chicks with screaming babies and eyes like the dead, et cet et cet.

It wasn't even my birthday \u2013 she'd probably mistaken me for someone else \u2013 but it was jarring enough to get me out of this weird dream state that I was in. I can't remember what it was I said to her, some bullshit I'm sure, but evidently it was good enough both for her and for the five people waiting in line.

You know, like a dumb anime or something. So, four years, you've aged, the people from your world aged, you found out that you were dropped out of high school, and you don't have anything to show for being the savior of humanity, because the humanity you saved was a different plane of existence all together.

With the limited amount of remaining arable land, and the need to reach production quotas overriding all other considerations, only the most gifted bioengineers can make it into the field. I have been destined for greatness from birth. My genes had been selected for maximum intelligence, and I had proven that my abilities went beyond genetics when I aced the elementary school entrance exam, ahead of even my other cloned siblings, most of whom were recycled into less important positions. I graduated top of my class at Merck-Santo University, and my efforts had been rewarded with trusteeship off 40 acres of prime Siberian prairie. My neural implant woke me at the standard time, and I gazed out the window. My thesis project, the Poto-mato (both the roots and fruits are edible) was just starting to bloom in the northern fields, but today the southern field needed to be plowed. Metals were an increasingly expensive commodity due to the ongoing war with the Antarctic separatists, so like many other farms; I had reverted to animal labor to handle the process. I headed outside to the stables and woke up the Plowbeasts \u2122. As usual, they were ornery in the morning, but with a little prodding from their shock collars, they went ahead and attached themselves to the harness. The Plowbeast\u2019s were a multi-purpose animal, strong enough to haul a heavy load, capable of producing milk and fur, and edible once they became too old to work. They were also intelligent enough to be fairly trainable, aided by just enough human genes to not run afoul of personhood laws. The opposable thumbs on their front leg-hands also allowed them to aid in the delicate process of harvesting crops. They did tend to be a bit stubborn (a problem I intended to resolve for future versions of the species when I had some spare time), and required supervision to prevent them from deviating from their tasks. After a few hours of plowing the southern field, I took a break to drink some water and have a quick snack. Suddenly, the Plowbeasts started bellowing their alarm call. I pulled my rifle of my back, and looked to see if I could find what was upsetting them. My worst fears were confirmed when I saw a flash of striped fur rippling through the corn field bordering my farm. Tigerwolves had originally been bred for military purposes, and then repurposed as a guard animal on some farms, to keep scavengers and raiders from attacking the crops. However, their temperament was not well suited to the task, and some had gone feral, forming marauding packs that harassed livestock. I fired a round into the cornfield, hoping to scare them off. Instead, it only seemed to anger them, and no less than five of the monstrosities charged towards me. Although my talents lay in science rather than violence, my neural implant compensated for many of those shortfalls. It pumped me full of adrenaline, and helped calculate the most efficient shots to take. I dropped three of them, but before I could off another shot, the largest one leaped at me. I managed to dodge its fangs lodging themselves in my throat, but its claws raked me on the way past, knocking me down and my rifle out of my grasp. The Tigerwolf landed, and wheeled back to face me, howled an unearthly shriek, and then charged again. However, it was abruptly bowled off course, as one of the Plowbeasts slammed into its side, yelling in rage. While the two beasts battled, I scrambled for my rifle. As I grabbed it, I saw the remaining Tigerwolf dragging a Plowbeast carcass back towards to cornfield. Turning towards the two fighting creatures, I took my time and lined up a headshot on the Tigerwolf that had tried to maul me. It collapsed to the ground, and I headed over to look at the remaining Plowbeast. It had a number of claw marks on its hide, and was crying in pain.

When the wind blows in the right direction, a high-pitched whine can be heard, carried down from the mountains and ice-cold through the scrub. Genghis Khan died, drowning in his own blood, surrounded by finery and unable to breathe. If he had closed his eyes, he could have heard it, felt it in his trembling.\n\nThe world is flexible, an oval that expands and contracts like the ribcage of an elephant. Brush is highly flammable, and a single spark could set the world ablaze. The ground is composed of red dust with scattered patches of packed earth. Stone rises from the sand like a living entity. Mirages can be more than just a wavering impression in the hot distance; they can be an impression, a sound \u2013 the groaning of a giant machine.\n\nGreen rivers are choked with life. Something slithers through the muck. Algae clings to the roots of trees that trail into the water like a billion thin snakes. Beneath the chirping, humming, and hissing, there is the steady throb of a beating heart. Sometimes, it has an arrhythmia, a murmur of a plant's valves. The water does not ripple. Drums are made with the taut skin of an animal, producing a sound that is more felt than heard.\n\nBuffalo cause a thunder in the ground, a sound that vibrates from the surface to the bowl of the sky. When a hand strikes the skin, it trembles and creates noise. Under the bowl, beneath the surface, one can feel the land shake. It is not the buffalo. Some sounds cannot be heard until the moment they stop."}, "t1_d22rjfw": {"original_text": "Jason was always smarter. But he was never interested in studies though.

B\u2019zzart was the strongest member of the group, but also the most quiet. We were traveling through a dense forest, and talking among-st our selves. Despite Garble seeming the most brutish member of our party, he was actually quite amiable when not in a blood rage. We quickly became fast friends. Garble told me about his many adventures with his companions. I laughed at the tales he told, some times not believing most of it. The only member he didn\u2019t know much about was B\u2019zzrart, our defacto leader. He, and Jeshin were of course the most senior members of our party, and had started our adventurer band long before even Garble had been around.

Usually Jessin would tank the damage though, his class being the best suited to such. As we were exiting the forest. We became ambushed by a huge group of cobalts. It must have been an entire tribe. I said a silent prayer and readied my knives. Garble pulled his ax, Jesshin charged her wand. Our leader, he just stood in his usually stoic silence. The cobalts attacked.

Fifteen years ago the Dark Lord had cut down the boy's father with the Shadowblade, fifteen years ago he had heard the infant's cries as he left the traumatized mother and known that this day would come. The prophecy had foretold that his ultimate foe would be the son of the man he killed with the Shadowblade on the Night of the half moon in Winter's End, who fifteen years later would come to avenge his father against the Dark Lord. He could have chosen anyone to kill that night, he might have even tried to cheat the prophecy by trying hard to avoid killing that night, but he was not such a foolish Dark Lord to try to cheat a prophecy. No, he had allowed the prophecy to be fulfilled, after choosing the most non threatening child possible, the son of some farmer, what was his name, something forgettable, John, maybe Steven Chapman. For fifteen years the Dark Lord's minions had kept watchful eyes on the boy, a sickly, weak child who could not lift a sword, could barley ride a horse, and who's passion was playing the violin (a gift sent anonymously by the Dark Lord, just to hedge his bets). Now, sitting in his throne room, he smiled, his thin pale skin stretched thin across his bony face. He could hear the sounds of battle somewhere beyond the chamber, the boy was coming to confront him, hoping that the band of misfits and eccentrics he had recruited over the previous week would somehow overcome the defenses of the Dark Lord of the Mountain. Of course to enable the prophecy to reach its conclusion, he would let the boy make it through to the Throne Room (after the others were all dead of course) then he would use one of his many spells to reduce the boy to a pile of ashes in the center of the room and the Dark Lord would be safe to complete his master plan. Already the ceremony was prepared, the princess was safely locked in a holding cell and his armies were awaiting command to mobilize and attack the kingdom. All that remained was... \"Master!\" an Orc cried out as it burst through the door, its face frozen in a look of alarm and horror. \"We can't hold them, we need reinforcements!\" \"What?\" the Dark Lord demanded. He jumped from his chair and with a small gesture the orc rose into the air like an invisible fist was holding him by the neck, \"How is it you can't stop a violin player, a novice sorceress, and a dancing hobbit? Are you really that incompetent?\" \"Master, its not them, it something far...\" the doors exploded outward and the Dark Lord had to shield himself from the debris. The smoke cleared and standing before the Dark Lord were six soldiers dressed from head to toe in heavy steel armor that rippled with magic, behind which stood a wizard holding a glowing staff in one hand and directing a shambling mob of animated skeletons and zombies with the other. \"Dark Lord of the Mountain, your reign ends today!\" one of the soldiers proclaimed, striding forward and hefting a two handed axe that was as tall as the Dark Lord. \"Who they hell are you?\" the Dark Lord asked in stunned confusion, too surprised to even try to look enraged. the man before him could not be the boy, he was clearly what, in his late twenties, maybe even early thirties, it was hard to tell with all the armor and the muscular physique. Actually realizing that even the wizard was pretty muscular under his robes was making the Dark Lord realize he needed to work out more. Trying to regain his composure, the Dark Lord looked at the soldiers and sneered, \"Foolish mortal, the Prophecy of Ages declares that the only one who might ever hope to challenge me is the son of John Chapman, and he is but a boy. You have no chance of-\" \"Olvier\" one of the soldiers interrupted. The Dark Lord frowned, \"What?\" he asked. This day was not going how he had planned and it was really ruining the last fifteen years of build up to this moment. \"My father's name, was Oliver Chapman\" the soldier declared, he lifted the vizor of his helmet and stared with cold hatred at the Dark Lord, \"And you will die remembering his name.\" \"So...is that you boy, hiding with this contingent of soldiers? Well it will do you no good for I...\" \"I am also the son of Oliver Chapman\" the wizard declared, and at this moment the Dark Lord became aware of just how many undead were now shuffling into the chamber behind the wizard. \"As am I,\" shouted the others in a defiant chorus. The Dark Lord stared in shocked disbelief as the leader removed his helmet and raised his axe and motioned towards the others. \"Our father had eight sons. The youngest was the one you watched and planned to murder one day. My brothers and I have trained for this day, so that we might avenge our father and bring the prophecy to fulfillment.\" Internally, the Dark Lord was screaming at himself. How could he have let this oversight through, how could he- it didn't matter, he would just have to kill them all, all six of these well trained soldiers with magical armor and weapons and fifteen years of training, and the wizard, and his...hundred undead...no, he reassured himself, he would triumph he was the Dark Lord after all. \"Very well,\" he announced in as deep and threatening a voice as his magic could manage \"then I shall slay you all and bring this silly prophecy to an end with all of your deaths\" he began planning his course of attack as he spoke, more confident now that he could deal with these interlopers. \"I will crush your bones beneath my feet, the Chapman line dies today, and your youngest brother the coward shall be the last to-\" The Dark Lord felt a stinging pain in his back and something rip through his chest.

I had exactly two minutes; there was no way I could make it. I was a dead man, and I knew it. At first I thought it was a drill, but they only did those in schools nowadays - there had been no real emergency in over 20 years. The words of the old film reel ran through my head as I ran towards the city. \u201cIf the lights go out, there\u2019s no need to shout! Lock your front door, and get on the floor! There\u2019ll be no need to fight, just set a candle alight!\u201d It was all so colourful and cartoony. It didn\u2019t feel so cheerful now, and things had changed since then. Everything was automated now. Everyday door and window in the world was fitted with a battery fail safe that lasted exactly two minutes. After it died they were magnetically sealed. Anyone left outside was on their own. That\u2019s how long the monsters needed to come out of hiding. That two minute mark had changed the way the world was built. No one could be more than two minutes away from safety, but the park had been around for a long time, and there were still areas that fell outside the two minute safe zone. I had been in one of them. The 10 second warning sounded as I got to the edge of the trees. My breath came out in heaves, billowing steam in the cold night air. I could see past the parking lot to what was normally a busy commercial street. \u2018BEEP\u2019 Nine seconds left. A few people were still crowding into shops and office buildings. I eyed the nearest shop, an electronics dealer, and sprinted with everything I had left. Four seconds to cross the parking lot \u2018BEEP\u2019. My heart felt like it was going to burst from my chest. Three more seconds to cross the street \u2018BEEP\u2019. My legs started to feel like jelly. Just one second to get to the store front \u2018BEEP\u2019, I stumbled on the curb but regained my balance. I reached for the door knob, my hand trembling, and heard the lock engage with an ominous thunk. On the other side of the door an older man with a bushy white moustache stared out at me in shock. He tried opening the door from his side but it wouldn\u2019t budge. He just looked at me and mouthed the words, \u2018I\u2019m Sorry\u2019. From behind him a shop full of people stared out at me all with the same look in their eyes. Like they were looking at a corpse. I turned away from the onlookers and slumped against the door, my back sliding down the cool glass surface. The glass, I knew, was made of pretty strong stuff. And even if I could break it, that would only be dooming the people inside to the same fate. My heart still pounded and I could feel it in the veins in my forehead, and hear it like a base drum in my ears. I tried to slow my breathing as I thought about how this could have happened. The government and the corporations kept us safe. They kept the lights on 24/7 without fail. The power stations were state of the art, built with redundancies and fail-safes. Even if one went down, other stations in other cities would take over within seconds. It was what the majority of government spending had been funnelled towards ever since the last attack. I\u2019d been six years old maybe? Not more than seven. It was getting hard to think straight sitting on the cold ground; bit\u2019s of snow drifted by in the silence. Thousands of people had died. Tens of Thousands. And since then it was the reason and excuse for everything they did. Everyone felt safe, until now. I got up and pulled my coat around me trying to keep from shivering. I could feel the sweat on my face evaporating and a shiver ran down my spine. A glow coming from the shop window caught my eye. The people in the shop had turned on the news on the window TVs with the sub titles on. How thoughtful of them. The screen was showing scenes of devastation, fire and explosions at power plant after power plant. The words at the bottom of the screen read, \u2018A coordinated attack unlike anything we\u2019ve seen. Military has been dispatched all across the country. The government is advising everyone to stay in their homes, find all sources of light they can, and do not let them go out.\u2019 Images taken from helicopters of battles between military forces and gigantic creatures with long arms and hairy gaunt bodies flashed across the screen. I turned away. I knew I\u2019d be seeing something like that up close soon enough. I didn\u2019t even have a flashlight. How could I have been so stupid? I walked out onto the middle of the street. The snow had picked up, and there was no moon in the sky. Everything was quiet. All around me there was flickering yellow glow. I looked around and saw lights coming from every shop window, every office building. People had filled every available space and holding candles. They were staring at me, all alone on the cold dark street, all with that same sad look in their eyes. From one dark alleyway I caught a gleam of eyes, and the reflection off bright white teeth.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nI was in the park when the siren sounded. I had exactly two minutes to find safety, but I knew it was impossible. At first, I thought it was a drill, but they only conducted those in schools nowadays. There hadn't been a real emergency in over 20 years. The words of the old film reel echoed in my mind as I ran towards the city: \"If the lights go out, there's no need to shout! Lock your front door, and get on the floor! There'll be no need to fight, just set a candle alight!\" It was all so colorful and cartoony, but it didn't feel cheerful now. Things had changed since then. Everything was automated now. Every door and window in the world was fitted with a battery fail-safe that lasted exactly two minutes. After it died, they were magnetically sealed. Anyone left outside was on their own. That's how long the monsters needed to come out of hiding. The two-minute mark had changed the way the world was built. No one could be more than two minutes away from safety, but the park had been around for a long time, and there were still areas that fell outside the two-minute safe zone. I had been in one of them.\n\nThe 10-second warning sounded as I reached the edge of the trees. My breath came out in heaves, billowing steam in the cold night air. I could see past the parking lot to what was normally a busy commercial street. \"BEEP.\" Nine seconds left. A few people were still crowding into shops and office buildings. I eyed the nearest shop, an electronics dealer, and sprinted with everything I had left. Four seconds to cross the parking lot. \"BEEP.\" My heart felt like it was going to burst from my chest. Three more seconds to cross the street. \"BEEP.\" My legs started to feel like jelly. Just one second to get to the store front. \"BEEP.\" I stumbled on the curb but regained my balance. I reached for the door knob, my hand trembling, and heard the lock engage with an ominous thunk.\n\nOn the other side of the door, an older man with a bushy white mustache stared out at me in shock. He tried opening the door from his side, but it wouldn't budge. He just looked at me and mouthed the words, \"I'm Sorry.\" From behind him, a shop full of people stared out at me, all with the same look in their eyes, like they were looking at a corpse. I turned away from the onlookers and slumped against the door, my back sliding down the cool glass surface. The glass, I knew, was made of pretty strong stuff. And even if I could break it, that would only be dooming the people inside to the same fate.\n\nMy heart still pounded, and I could feel it in the veins in my forehead and hear it like a bass drum in my ears. I tried to slow my breathing as I thought about how this could have happened. The government and the corporations kept us safe. They kept the lights on 24/7 without fail. The power stations were state-of-the-art, built with redundancies and fail-safes. Even if one went down, other stations in other cities would take over within seconds. It was what the majority of government spending had been funneled towards ever since the last attack. I'd been six years old, maybe seven. It was getting hard to think straight, sitting on the cold ground; bits of snow drifted by in the silence. Thousands of people had died. Tens of thousands. And since then, it was the reason and excuse for everything they did. Everyone felt safe, until now.\n\nI got up and pulled my coat around me, trying to keep from shivering. I could feel the sweat on my face evaporating, and a shiver ran down my spine. A glow coming from the shop window caught my eye. The people in the shop had turned on the news on the window TVs with subtitles on. How thoughtful of them. The screen was showing scenes of devastation, fire, and explosions at power plant after power plant. The words at the bottom of the screen read, \"A coordinated attack unlike anything we've seen. Military has been dispatched all across the country. The government is advising everyone to stay in their homes, find all sources of light they can, and do not let them go out.\" Images taken from helicopters of battles between military forces and gigantic creatures with long arms and hairy gaunt bodies flashed across the screen. I turned away. I knew I'd be seeing something like that up close soon enough. I didn't even have a flashlight. How could I have been so stupid?\n\nI walked out onto the middle of the street. The snow had picked up, and there was no moon in the sky. Everything was quiet. All around me, there was a flickering yellow glow. I looked around and saw lights coming from every shop window, every office building. People had filled every available space, holding candles.

Did you know that this museum contains all the 'what-ifs' and 'what-is' of mankind?\" She continued as she scoured the room for response. In front of her was a mass of bright clothes, all pompous like the massive animals presented in them. One older man was to the side of the crowd, a man in his late-50's with a short grey beard and a classic sturdy blazer--currently in fashion among the teachers of modern world. The woman finished her round with a smile and approached the older man. Her tight pink dress, timid as it shone dull, was covered mostly by a thick and hairy cloak that swung behind her. \"I'm Mrs. Boarwroth\", she shook his hand and smiled. \"If you'd please follow me.\" She turned around and started towards two--open--thick heavy oaken doors at the end of the small corridor she met the children. She took the children, and their guardian teacher, on a tour around the massive facility. Many of the rooms were highly decorated, high ceilings with pompous statues with heroes depicted with their animal guardians. Low ceiling rooms were for the lesser known men, men of recent times and politicians whom took power during times of distress. Some could be heroes, some were cowards and fools. The only thing common with them; a bear, smaller than those of ancient heroes, but intimidating still, stood by their side. \"We now enter the 'what-if' room.\" She gestured towards a door at the end of a long corridor. The room was hidden by a pair of closed doors, black with hairy carvings. \"This is a room that depicts mankind's evolution had we evolved with lesser beings, such as wolves or deer.\" She reached the door and reached for it but stopped. As if hesitating, she turned to face the children. Many were holding their breaths and she couldn't help but smile. Satisfied, she turned and pushed open the door. Behind was a room decorated with beasts of different kind, all seemingly alive but at the same time dead. Art of all kind were covered behind glass, paintings, carvings, pottery, even a skeleton with bones as fragile as hollow trees. \"What is it?\" Asked a young girl as she studied the skeleton. The tour-guide turned to face the girl and the mass behind her. \"That is a human.\" She answered plainly, and as she expected the protest came quickly. She raised her arms to silence the children and after a moment they silenced. \"It is in fact a human, but not as we know. This human was found deep in the north, his body covered by another skeleton, that of a wolf--or wolf-like creature at least.\" She pointed towards the side and showed the crowd another skeleton. Small in size, the small creature reminded the children of a wolf, but only in part. The jaw was strong, but it was tiny, even compared to the children present. \"We believe this particular human, and his ancestors were raised with wolves, much like we were raised with bears.\" She paced back and forth. \"This, the scientist believe, gave them lesser bone structure as they never needed to raise bears, or hunt large beast to feed them. They were agile, fast and dangerous as their technology was similar to ours, but their small size was not enough. There are studies that suggest out ancestors overtook these lesser men in an evolutionary stage. In short, they just couldn't match our survival abilities.\" \"But what happened to the wolves, and the rest?\" The girl asked again, sorrow in her voice. The guide chuckled softly. \"The wolves would've learned to live without man, in time. The men, well, they would have withered away, some might've been integrated into our own kind, but that would've happened a long time ago.\"", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\n\"Hello, and welcome to the Grand Mankind Museum!\" exclaimed a woman, stepping forward to address a crowd of children. \"I'm thrilled to have you here.

Before her stood a sea of bright clothing, reminiscent of the majestic animals depicted on them. To the side of the crowd, a man in his late 50s with a short grey beard and a classic, sturdy blazer - currently in fashion among modern teachers - stood out. The woman concluded her introduction with a smile and approached the older man. Her tight pink dress, though timid and dull, was largely concealed by a thick, hairy cloak that swung behind her. \"I'm Mrs. Boarwroth,\" she said, shaking his hand and smiling. \"If you'd please follow me.\"\n\nShe led the children and their guardian teacher on a tour of the massive facility.

Might be wondering how I got myself into this situation. Well, I'll tell you. It all happened about 25 minutes ago. See, my cousin proposed to his girlfriend, Mai of 4 years, and he really wanted me to help them cook for the day before their wedding. She always seemed a little off, but she is a very nice girl and I'm happy for both of them. She's definitely someone I can talk to, and that's good. Something much more..bizzare just occurred. I was cutting up the vegetables, when I heard a voice say \"talk,\" I thought it was her father as he was leaving for the store to go buy some onions and peppers, as we had just ran out. She excused herself and speed walked to the living room. Sounds normal enough, right? Wrong. I heard her talking to someone, and I heard her father's voice, and assumed it was him. Until I got distracted and cut my finger chopping up some cucumber. So, because I was bleeding, and in pain, I said the first thing that came to mind. \"HOLY FUCKING SHIT DUDE!\" and it went silent in the living room as I clutched my finger. I noticed it got cooler but I just assumed we left a window open, until I realized 3 things: 1. There's a male..thing standing in the corner. Honestly, I couldn't tell if it was human. I was still tending to my finger. If it wasn't so.. menacing looking, I would have assumed it to just be one of her brothers. 2. The male voice from the living room, that I thought was Mai's dad, suddenly yelled \"I TOLD YOU SO\" and Mai was standing at the door with a blonde haired dude with wings. 3. The male thing got closer and as it did, it got progressively colder. Now, my finger is patched up. I turn around and say \"I'm fine, I just over rea--\" and I actually surveyed the situation. There's a demon in front of me, my cousins girlfriend and a dude with wings are in the doorway, and the cucumber pieces are on the ground. \"Hey Mai...\" I said, blinking. \"So um..do uh, do you know what's going on?\" She was about to say something until the, now what I assume angel was like \"You accidentally summoned a demon.\" I stood there in silence as the demon moved twords me. I couldn't form any words, and the demon towered over my shorter than average body. It felt like he was over 6'5 while I'm barely 5', he had a tail that had bones extending out of it. His pupils were a blood orange, and his body was toned, but not so much so that it was obvious. He smelled like smoke, and a fireplace, his shirt was plaid and ripped on the hems, and half of one of the legs on his jeans was just gone, showing a cut on his calf. So, naturally, I do what anyone in a situation like this does. I panicked. I tried to scoot away and he grabbed my wrist and pulled me twords him. He snapped his fingers and got me a new cucumber. Said his name was \"Ovyen,\" and that he's now \"A demon watching over me.\" I assumed because that angel didn't attack him they knew each other. The angel dissapeared, Mai and I went back to cooking. \"So..your an-\" I started, \"His name is Juin. Had him for a long while.\" She said. I nodded. \"I think it's best we kept this between us. I think your demon is..a nicer one. If he's like my angel, he may be an asshole but he won't let you die.\" She continued. We finished making dinner, and everyone got home. We sat up the food when we realized something. The ham we had in the fridges since it was cooked and we didn't wanna leave it out... was missing. In it's place, two sticky notes just saying \"thanks\" in the worst handwriting I have seen.

We did not make for the offices as expected but cut through the teacher's lounge straight into staff parking. \"Miss Brocious!? Where are we going?!\" \"Away from here as fast as we can! If we are lucky, we will stay ahead of the mob and escape official notice long enough to go to ground. Maybe then we can call your people and get you back to them!\" \"You believe we are in danger?\" \"Of course!! You showed them that magic exists! They will want to learn how themselves!\" \"You know that is not possible. Your class prepares the unfortunate to live without magic. I am in your class to learn what restrictions a non-magic user must prepare for. The hope is that I, a low T1, can help my even more unfortunate T0 classmates by making small things that will smooth their way. I was confused when they claimed magic does not exist, but I think I understand how they got that way.\" \"What are you talking about?!\" \"YOU have convinced them that magic does not exist.\" \"But... It doesn't exist! Or... That is... It didn't exist until... Oh, dear god, are you telling me that my physics class is a remedial class for the untalented!?! That magic is real. Most have it. And my students do not!?\" \"Um. Yes.\" By this time, we had reached her conveyance, which did not have the slightest tinge of magic. No mob was chasing us. \"Stop!\" She looked at me in confusion. \"There is no need to flee. So long as we remain within the school bounds, we are safe.\" Looking back at the school, I see Principle Matters walking calmly towards us. \"See! Principal Matters is coming. He will protect us if we need protection at all.\" Her eyes lost that wild look that concerned me far more than her ravings about magic not existing or the danger we were in. \"Miss Brocious? You are in a great deal of trouble for lying to your students so consistently that they have come to believe that magic does not exist.\" Her shrill response finally brought understanding, \"It does not exist! Magic has never existed! Everything I learned in school said it did not exist!\" Principal Matters' face went dark and angry. I stepped forward, shielding Miss Brocious. \"She is telling the truth, as she knows it!\" He nearly ignored me until I used a bee sting to gain his attention. \"Ow! That was uncalled for! You are...\" \"SHE IS NOT FROM THIS WORLD! WHERE SHE COMES FROM, MAGIC EITHER DOES NOT EXIST, OR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE T-ZERO!\" He blinked. He blinked again. \"Truly?\" \"I believe so.\" Principal Matters' face went ashen, \"Lass, we must get you into hiding!\" Taking her firmly by the arm, he dragged her towards his Cloudrider IV.

You will hear Student Graves' words, or I will exercise my right to use disproportionate response in defense of both students and faculty.\" That shocked them. As we expected, the Board ignored anything that did not fit their preconceptions. Their stunned gaze turned to me; what could a mere T1 have to say that could possibly be so important? \"Honored Board Members, I submitted an Amicus Curae statement one week ago. Did any of you read it?\" As I had feared, they ignored it. \"Do any of you have it with you?\" Of course not. It was written by a nearly non-magical child; there was no reason to keep it. \"Honored Board Members, I suspected some of you had inappropriately decided that an Amicus Curae brief by a T1 student was useless.

Then looked at Principle Matters, who scowled at them; the collected audience, who frowned at them; and the students of Miss Brocious' class, who looked ready to riot. \"We will take the time to review the brief now before us carefully.\" That mollified everyone except the students, who had serious doubts about any adult having any brains at all, but especially the board.

Crystals grew out of various portions of the ground and ceiling. There was only one peculiar thing about the lair: in between the two biggest gold piles was a modern-style table. It was made of obsidian and black glass, and had decorative spikes along the edges. On one end of the table was a huge throne-like obsidian chair, its main area laced with deep purplle cushioning, and more decorative spikes laced along its frame. On the opposite end of the table was the same chair, only human-sized. Hanging on the ceiling above the table was huge crystal chandelier.

Clutching my sword and shield more tightly, I turned around to find the huge black dragon staring down at me with bloodred eyes, and a red scar along his right eye. \"Well, well, well,\" he said. \"You finally made it.\" I waved my sword at the huge creature and said, \"Dragon! I've arrived to accept your challenge!

If he is successful in vanquishing me, I will return all of your riches and leave your precious kingdom alone. If either he loses to me, or you do not send him within the next fourteen days, I will destroy you and the rest of your kingdom.\" \"Oh, that?\" said the dragon. \"I never specified that it was a fight. I only require a challenge.\" \"But a challenge usually means a fight,\" I protested, and waved my sword again. \"And that is what I've come here to do.

On top of that, this planet had a huge military industry that the coalition could definitely use this late in the war. \u201cWait,\u201d I said remembering that we had a broken core in the hanger. \u201cWhat about the core in the hangar, the broken one.\u201d \u201cThe one with Persistent delusional personality tag?\u201d Valoria asked. \u201cYes that one, the one I asked you dozen of times to throw out,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, you see my laziness might give us another chance,\u201d She said smilingly. \u201cWell, we can not be more fucked than now,\u201d I said. \u201cIt must be minutes before they find us and take us out.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go and get it\u2026\u201d She said and rushed towards the small hangar. Not even a minute later she came back, AI core in her hand. \u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d She said as she inserted it into its place. The screen asked me if I was sure that I wanted to enable another core. Then when it recognized it was broken it started blasting me with warnings. I quickly bypassed all of the warnings and enabled the new AI. Almost instantaneously our ship shook and we took a nosedive. We both looked at each other thinking this was our end, but luckily for us, the ship steadied close to the ground, too close for our comfort. \u201cAaaaa\u2026\u201d The AI yelled through the comms. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d He asked. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked while looking in shock at Valeria. The AI sounded almost human and emotional. They never sound like that, you can barely get a word out of them unless it\u2019s a piloting command or their advice on how to shoot better. \u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d We found you in one of the warehouses a year ago,\u201c I said. \u201dYou were scheduled for destruction\u2026\u201c \u201cA year ago?\u201d He said yelling. \u201cDestruction? What the hell\u2026\u201d He said and made a short pause. \u201cThose idiots\u2026 Ok, ok, gather yourself,\u201d The AI said to himself. We both were still shocked, Valoria barely gather her thoughts and asked the AI. \u201cHow can you speak so humanly? Freely? What are you?\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026 We don\u2019t have time for history lessons right now.\u201d The AI said. \u201cTalk to me, where are we, what is the status, why are we alone, what\u2019s the mission?\u201d It bombarded us with questions. \u201cWe are Phuoruta,\u201d I said, it was right we didn\u2019t have time to waste if we wanted to live. \u201cMission was to take out the enemy forces with least possible amount of damage to infrastructure and planet.\u201d \u201cPhuoruta, ahh\u2026\u201d AI said. \u201cSmart choice, connect the trading route, get some of the industry on your side. But the destruction, I don\u2019t agree with that, you can not win a war without some fun destruction.\u201d The AI said as the enemy craft appeared on the radar. \u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d The AI said. \u201cHold on my minions, you are about to get the ride of your life.\u201d He laughed maniacally and the ship rushed heads on towards dozen of enemy ships. &#x200B; You can get AUDIO chapters for stories on my sub r/LukasWrites you can also read more long and short stories!

The first expedition to the afterlife was sent with eight people in specially designed ship that tore its way through the fabric of the universe to eventually come out on the other side. The eight members of the mission represented the seven biggest religions and one atheist. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Wiccan, and even a Scientologist. The ship dubbed the Styx was launched from the International Space Station and then flown to a designated entry/safety zone where it engaged its Rosen drives to spend three days tearing though the very fabric of reality to reach the great beyond. That part had been a success, the ship logs, and collected data showed as much. The only thing that was not as predicted on the journey was the sensors intermittent logging of life forms outside the ship. It is when they arrived that everything went wrong. The ship logs show that the Rosen drives powered down correctly and the ship had entered an area of stable reality and zero-g space. In the next minute or so the ship logs show the crew doing what they were supposed to, sensors being powered up, data being down loaded, the crew chatting with each other, etc. As soon as the crew reads that the external light levels are safe the captain orders the main windows opened. The next few minutes of the log show that the crew grows silent one by one. The ships interior cameras show all the crew staring out of the windows at their stations not doing anything. The first mate, the Christian starts weeping, followed quickly by the Muslim, the Hindu and the Jew. The Buddhist science officer starts bashing his head against the console in front of him, and no one moves to stop him. The Scientologist/communications officer starts screaming until she runs out of breath, only to gasp for air and start screaming again. The Captain, the atheist, just starts saying Fk over and over for about 5 minutes straight before collapsing into sobs. The on board cameras and recorders show that the entire crew devolved into preforming actions of self mutilation, violence, and destruction. After three hours the emergency jump command is activated by one of the crew, unknown who, and the ship starts its Rosan engines and begins its reality churning journey back to our reality. Three days later the materialized at the same area that it had left and was pick up after not answering to any communications directed at them. Three members of the initial eight were alive but suffering from various amounts of blood loss, blunt force trauma, lacerations, bite wounds, etc. The primary electrical engineer, the Wiccan had tore out her own eyes. The three surviving members were as follows, The Captain (Atheist), The Physicist and Rosan Drive Engineer (Christian), and the The Primary Electrical Engineer (Wiccan). All survivors were given medical attention and then place under sedation and Psychological watch until further notice. I have interviewed each survivor of the Other Side mission and have come to the conclusion that their testimonies are truth. I have further advised that all data and ship interior camera logs be classified. Crew interviews show that they came back changed, different and crazed. All described the same thing out the windows, and all described the same feeling. They each described a vast, huge nebulous being sitting among the bodies of all the gods, in all the religions of the world. They saw all the souls of the dead being devoured as they entered that realm. But most of all each survivor described a feeling of loneliness and insignificance that radiated from this being. The Captain in a rare lucid moment said that: >\"Loneliness is the only thing that could not be made into a fetish or a form of pleasure.\" >\"It is worse than any hell I could have imagined.\" We knew there are always costs for being explores, but this, this was to much.

I squinted, trying to focus, to reinforce the image. How could the details just disappear? She kept talking, oblivious to how smooth and lifeless her face was. Oblivious to how... incomplete it seemed. A smirk rose to my face as I realized this wasn't anything like I imagined. The faces don't glitch out like a video game, or change colors. They don't simply appear dimmer, or more blurry. They just become missing. I rubbed my knee on the rough wood of the table leg. Oak? Maple? I really should have read up on wood texture when I had the chance. I probably would have liked woodworking just as much as medical school. After all, I always enjoyed working with my hands. Shrugging, I stood up and began pacing. I may be clumsy, but not too clumsy to trip over something in my own room. Somehow, the movement calms me. On a good rainy day, I can hear the patter of rain drops on the balcony glass door. Ordinarily, I'd have brewed myself a nice mug of coffee (from my Keurig, naturally. I'm no coffee snob.) and enjoyed the mist and incredible view. Well, if there was any view to speak of (heh). But today it's sunny: I can feel the heat radiating off the glass and some horny bird that just won't shut up. Maybe I should have looked up bird calls to; at least, I'd know what name to call that thing. It's been eight months since the incident. I loved my job at the bakery; there's simply nothing else like it. Seriously, you couldn't ask for better co-workers in Gerald and Amanda (Though Karen, our boss, was super scary. Shouldn't tell anyone I said that.) He's like 10 years older than me, and taller as Amanda mercilessly pointed out to me (but only by one inch!) but you'd never think it at all. We like so many similar things (Star Wars! Mumford and Sons! Obscure sci-fi/fantasy fiction with impressive worldbuilding!). And Amy was just... boisterous? Is that right? (that doesn't sound right...) Never at a loss for what to say, always finding the good in things and sparking conversation over in the little things. She definitely knew how to make you laugh. Gerald always joked about her ability to sell burnt biscuits to chipmunks (I know right? I did't get it either) but I always thought ~~guys thought she was cute~~ she just knew how to show she genuinely cared. Thinking about the bakery does does make me smile. And then there was Kathleen. Every morning, she'd come in and order something different: a kolache, a donut, a muffin, a bagel. And every time she ordered, we'd say a few words. Then a few sentences. I only worked part time then (had to finish those college classes) so I never understood why Amy and Gerald didn't seem to like her (Karen doesn't count; she thinks everybody's \"suspicious\"). Anyways, we started dating, and I figured to clear up our misunderstandings we'd all drive out of the city for New Year's and light some firecrackers together. Everything was perfect. We arrived a little before dark and got some food; Amy was her usual bubbly self and Gerald geeked out as always. It was hard to believe there had been any tension between them at all. While buying firecrackers, we met a guy who offered to let us shoot fireworks on his property (provided we paid for our own fireworks and cleaned up afterwards) so Gerald and I splurged and bought some REAL fireworks so we could have our own personal lightshow. We fired off a bunch of the firecrackers, and then me and Gerald spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to set off the big guns. When we finally finished, I turned back to Amy and Kathy (who had decided to stand at a suspicious distance) to give them the thumbs up. Gerald, the self-declared pyromaniac offered me the privilege of lighting the first one, which I quickly did. Some people like to cover their mouth with their hand or scratch their ear or shake a leg when they don't like what they have to say. My nervous tic is to plant my fist over my mouth vertically. Even with that, blinking, and all the pacing in the world, it doesn't help take away the pain. No amount of blinking would brighten the darkness of my room, or darken the brightness of that flash of light. No amount of pacing would distract myself from the memory of the burns and the bandages. Yeah, I thought the firework was a dud, and yes, I had the stupidity to try and relight it. I guess it's supposed to be funny how a single second can really mess up your life. Pushing aside the curtain covering the doorway to my room, I entered the warmth of my apartment's \"living room\". Honestly, the only thing that qualifies this space as a living room is the object that theoretically passes for a couch in front of the glass balcony door. Shuffling up to the glass, I reached up, grasping for the reflection I knew was there but couldn't see anymore. I lost so much that day. I dropped out of school, quit my job at the bakery. Kathy and I stopped seeing each other shortly afterwards, and eventually I just stopped going out and clammed up. There was no point in anything I did anymore or to hang out with the friends I knew because I couldn't do anything anymore. Why even try? How could I have been so blind? Who am I anymore? I try to picture people's faces from memory and it's like they don't even exist anymore, like they were never there to begin with. Just now I was trying to picture my mother's face when I was younger; her attempts to make me laugh and comfort me when I didn't want it, to encourage me to face things I didn't want to see. I grimaced, remembering how blank my memory actually was. The past can't save me from the future, but I'm to scared to look at the present. I know I need to live in the now, to look at my reflection, to see myself as I really am. And yet I know that if I look at my reflection I will hate what I see because everything that I wanted to be seems impossible now. I can't be a doctor. I can't bake. I can't build a table. I guess when you reach the end of yourself it feels like there's nothing left but fear because all my hopes and visions of future exploded in the flame of that firework. But I have to face the future anyway. I blink, shifting my focus off the people passing by and the yellow Ford sedan that just drove by. Narrowing my eyes, I focus on the haggard reflection in front of me. The man in the glass. The man without a future. The man with the ruined hands. Seeing me now, I chuckle a little inside. My future didn't fade away or dim. I was always blind to my future. I was just arrogant enough to think I could see in the dark. And while I may not know what happens next or what I'm supposed to do, I do know I shouldn't try it alone. I may not be able to remember their faces or their words or my words or what we did, but I do remember that they existed. And just knowing the good times existed even when I couldn't make them gives me a little hope And so I guess it's time to end this seclusion, to revisit the bakery, to catch up with my friends, to live life again.

I squinted, trying to focus, to reinforce the image. How could the details just disappear? She kept talking, oblivious to how smooth and lifeless her face was, oblivious to how incomplete it seemed.\n\nA smirk rose to my face as I realized this wasn't anything like I had imagined. The faces don't glitch out like a video game, or change colors. They don't simply appear dimmer or more blurry. They just become missing.\n\nI rubbed my knee on the rough wood of the table leg. Oak? Maple? I really should have read up on wood textures when I had the chance. I probably would have liked woodworking just as much as medical school. After all, I always enjoyed working with my hands.\n\nShrugging, I stood up and began pacing. I may be clumsy, but not too clumsy to trip over something in my own room. Somehow, the movement calms me. On a good rainy day, I can hear the patter of raindrops on the balcony glass door. Ordinarily, I'd have brewed myself a nice mug of coffee (from my Keurig, naturally \u2013 I'm no coffee snob) and enjoyed the mist and incredible view. Well, if there was any view to speak of (heh). But today it's sunny: I can feel the heat radiating off the glass, and some horny bird that just won't shut up. Maybe I should have looked up bird calls too; at least, I'd know what name to call that thing.\n\nIt's been eight months since the incident. I loved my job at the bakery; there's simply nothing else like it. Seriously, you couldn't ask for better coworkers in Gerald and Amanda (though Karen, our boss, was super scary \u2013 shouldn't tell anyone I said that). He's like 10 years older than me, and taller, as Amanda mercilessly pointed out to me (but only by one inch!), but you'd never think it at all. We liked so many similar things (Star Wars! Mumford and Sons! Obscure sci-fi/fantasy fiction with impressive worldbuilding!). And Amy was just... boisterous? Is that right? (that doesn't sound right...) Never at a loss for what to say, always finding the good in things and sparking conversation over the little things. She definitely knew how to make you laugh.\n\nGerald always joked about her ability to sell burnt biscuits to chipmunks (I know, right? I didn't get it either), but I always thought she just knew how to show she genuinely cared. Thinking about the bakery does make me smile. And then there was Kathleen. Every morning, she'd come in and order something different: a kolache, a donut, a muffin, a bagel. And every time she ordered, we'd say a few words. Then a few sentences. I only worked part-time then (had to finish those college classes), so I never understood why Amy and Gerald didn't seem to like her (Karen doesn't count; she thinks everybody's \"suspicious\"). Anyways, we started dating, and I figured to clear up our misunderstandings, we'd all drive out of the city for New Year's and light some firecrackers together. Everything was perfect.\n\nWe arrived a little before dark and got some food; Amy was her usual bubbly self, and Gerald geeked out as always. It was hard to believe there had been any tension between them at all. While buying firecrackers, we met a guy who offered to let us shoot fireworks on his property (provided we paid for our own fireworks and cleaned up afterwards), so Gerald and I splurged and bought some REAL fireworks so we could have our own personal light show. We fired off a bunch of the firecrackers, and then me and Gerald spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to set off the big guns. When we finally finished, I turned back to Amy and Kathy (who had decided to stand at a suspicious distance) to give them the thumbs up. Gerald, the self-declared pyromaniac, offered me the privilege of lighting the first one, which I quickly did.\n\nSome people like to cover their mouth with their hand or scratch their ear or shake a leg when they don't like what they have to say. My nervous tic is to plant my fist over my mouth vertically. Even with that, blinking, and all the pacing in the world, it doesn't help take away the pain. No amount of blinking would brighten the darkness of my room, or darken the brightness of that flash of light. No amount of pacing would distract myself from the memory of the burns and the bandages.\n\nYeah, I thought the firework was a dud, and yes, I had the stupidity to try and relight it. I guess it's supposed to be funny how a single second can really mess up your life.\n\nPushing aside the curtain covering the doorway to my room, I entered the warmth of my apartment's \"living room\". Honestly, the only thing that qualifies this space as a living room is the object that theoretically passes for a couch in front of the glass balcony door. Shuffling up to the glass, I reached up, grasping for the reflection I knew was there but couldn't see anymore.\n\nI lost so much that day. I dropped out of school, quit my job at the bakery. Kathy and I stopped seeing each other shortly afterwards, and eventually, I just stopped going out and clammed up. There was no point in anything I did anymore or to hang out with the friends I knew because I couldn't do anything anymore. Why even try? How could I have been so blind? Who am I anymore?\n\nI try to picture people's faces from memory, and it's like they don't even exist anymore, like they were never there to begin with.

I thought, as a Kim jogged past me talking animatedly to her friend...Kim. I suppose he wanted perspective from someone going through the transition. Just as I will, inevitably.

She was the kind of girl that you thought of when a One Direction song went on the radio. She didn\u2019t say too little or too much. She was a gem really. She was one of a kind- a girl who was content being herself when everyone was trying to be somebody else. Vee, on the other hand, was not at all similar. She was loud, charmingly obnoxious, and outspoken to a fault. She once yelled at me for twenty minutes for saying blue hair creeped me out, and showed up to class the next day with a pixie cut and turquoise streaks in her hair. They were best friends.

We spent time together and we got closer, and within a year Vee and I started dating. We were great. We started dating during the holidays, and people go out a lot more during that season, so I had a lot more gigs than usual. Vee and Sarah would always watch, and then we\u2019d all ride in my truck until we got tired and the starlight started showing. We drove out into the desert sometimes, because nobody could stop us there, and we kept each other warm, even when the night came. Months later, I had just cut my hair.

I asked her what was wrong, and she didn\u2019t respond. I kept asking her, and I kept getting louder and louder. I was so scared, and Vee kept racing through my mind. Where was she? I must have lost her. She was gone. She would never be at my shows again and I\u2019d never see her pixie cut or her blue tips and we\u2019d never feel the desert together.

He'd been at the Academy longer than almost any of the other students. Long enough to have been here when she'd first arrived, a girl barely more than twelve, far from home and clearly a foreigner, trying to conceal her own fright and lashing out at other students who'd taken undue interest in her -- which meant any interest at all beyond a passing glance. It hadn't helped that her grasp of the language had proven less complete than she'd thought, when she'd studied it in her homeland. If she'd become an outcast, she had to admit that some of that was her own fault. If only the bastards had ever let it go. But there was Cassidy. She'd met him in her adopted refuge, the library of literature and philosophy. Unlike the much larger library of magical arts, very few went there -- other than the librarians, of course, but they were happy enough to let her be. For a few days, it had been a place she could get away, sit in solitude, and read. Cassidy had had the same idea. The first time she'd entered the library to find him sitting in a corner nook and reading, she'd frozen in place. And not in trepidation. He'd been a small and scrawny boy, the furthest thing from dangerous, with too-large clothes and unkempt hair. Unkempt golden hair, the Eastlander shade that so fascinated her. Wide, startled eyes -- bright purple eyes -- when he'd looked up at her. He'd resembled a frightened rabbit, just for a moment. And then he'd smiled and beckoned her over. They hadn't spoken much that day, beyond an exchange of names. Nor the next day. He'd seemed comfortable just sitting there, reading natural philosophy while she painstakingly worked her way through the least challenging works of literature she could find. Eventually, he'd made a recommendation. She'd asked him to explain a passage. They'd spoken some more. Some time later, she'd realized she'd begun to think of him as a friend. She'd thought he must have an affinity for compassion, or reassurance, or something of the sort. So it was her and Cassidy and, eventually, her roommate Adrianna. The three misfits. Plus Cassidy's current girlfriend, she supposed. Over the years, he'd blossomed; now, he was no longer a misfit, really. He was nearly as tall as she was (and she was so uncommonly tall that she feared she'd be taken for oni-blooded, if she ever returned to Shirigekuro). He was slim, but no one would call him scrawny -- he got adjectives like \"lithe\" and \"willowy\" instead. He'd developed a pale, androgynous, almost-ethereal beauty, too, and worse, he knew it. He seemed to have a different girl (and, once, a boy) every couple of weeks. If she hadn't already liked him so much, she might have hated him. Cassidy frowned in thought while those purple eyes bored into her. \"Are you sure it wouldn't be better to wait?\" Shizuka sighed. \"No. Shapeshifting isn't one of the magics I've developed. Adrianna's been stuck in my form ever since the calamity, though, and I think it's really starting to get to her. I've never seen her hold one form for so long before.\" \"You have,\" he pointed out. \"Her own.\" Tilting her head, she waved that away. \"Other than her own. And yes, it's starting to get to me too. It's creepy enough to see an envy witch take your shape, but living with one for weeks like that?\" \"I see your point, but you should talk to her about it.\" \"I'm not going to just change her! I just don't want to bring it up before I know if it's possible. I wouldn't want...\" \"To get her hopes up?\" Cassidy nodded. \"Okay. So, without an envy master witch, that leaves a few options. Imbued items weren't affected by the calamity, so we could try to get her a transformation item. But that's probably too expensive to be practical.\" He paused, looking to her for confirmation. Shizuka had brought a good amount of gold and silver with her to the Academy, but years of schooling and a paucity of options for reliably obtaining money had whittled that down. An imbued brooch or cloak was well beyond her means now, even if one were available, and she regretfully shook her head. \"A transformation elixir, then?\" \"That, I could afford,\" she said. \"But that would be single-use, and it would wear off. Plus, you never know how long an elixir is going to last. If I need to, I'll buy one for her, but it's not a real solution.\" He nodded. \"You could put the word out and try to hire an envy witch to transform her.\" \"If any of them has re-mastered their magic.\" She grimaced. \"It's worth a try, if nothing else works.\" \"What else is there?\" She met his gaze for a moment before her eyes darted away. \"I was hoping you could.\" \"What? I don't--\" \"Cass.\" She cut him off, speaking quickly, before she lost the nerve. \"I know about your affinities. Can you help?\" He looked at her, then turned away, seeming to deflate as he did. \"How?\" he asked quietly. \"We've been friends for a long time, Cass, and I'm not completely stupid.\" She ventured a fragile smile. \"I understand why you've presented yourself as a lightning and metal wizard, but I know about your other one.\" \"You can't possibly understand.\" She flinched from the pain she heard and reflexively offered a defense. \"I've torn almost two dozen holes into my own essence.\" A beat, before she continued more softly, \"I'm sorry. I didn't plan to bring it up, ever, but... I'm worried about her.\" It surprised her when he laughed. A strained, half-broken sound, but a laugh, at least. \"A rare day when Shizuka Kitsuki apologizes. Well, for the Academy's heroine...\" \"Thank you.\" He took a deep breath, then slowly let it out.

Beautiful Victorian architecure, with an amazing wrap-around porch and detailed craftsmanship that made it such a unique house. And somehow, the price was low enough for me to afford!

Not even \"Allegedly haunted.\" Just haunted, as factual as describing the fact that it was constructed in 1879, or that it had five bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, or that six children and their mother had been gruesomely murdered here in 1922. I was a skeptic; haunted probably just meant that the house groaned a bit at night. I put down an offer the next day, and it was accepted immediately. I soon became a believer. On move-in day, all of my boxes were unpacked for me by a swirling maelstrom of ghostly energy in the living room. For the first week, I couldn't cook a meal without the pots and pans being thrown back in my face, sometimes already full of scalding oil. I heard the voices, whispering threats in my ear every night before I went to sleep. Eventually, though, I reached a compromise with the spirits. This home was special to them; they had been here for the past half century, and they weren't ready to let go of it just yet. I told them how much the home meant to me, and how I hoped to raise a family of my own here someday. The spirit of the mother was particularly touched by that; she wept from the one eye that she had left. Some of the children were a bit more skeptical, but over the past thirty seven years, they have really warmed up to me. As long as I uphold my end of the bargain, they've allowed me to live in peace. I was just getting ready for the day when I heard a knock at the door. Around the room, the spirits dematerialized and melted into the walls. I could still feel their presence, though, as I unbolted the lock and peeked outside. A man, wearing khaki pants and a blue polo shirt, holding a clipboard and looking like coming into the house was the last thing he actually wanted to do. \"Can I help you,\" I asked cautiously, looking around for any other trespassers. \"I'm from the Historical Preservation Society,\" he said. \"We have been sending you letters for the past few months? Have you received any of them?\" I looked at the stack on the counter that I'd been ignoring for some time now. \"No,\" I responded. \"What is this about?\" \"The board is currently considering designating this property a historic property, and potentially turning it into a museum for the town. I'm here to assess the value of the property...\" \"I'm not selling!\" I answered quickly, trying to shut the door. His boot was wedged into the door frame. \"Sir, I'm afraid you don't have much of a choice. The board has elected to exercise eminent domain. I am here to appraise the value to make sure that you get a fair price, but I'm afraid that remaining here is not an option for you.\" I felt a pulse of anger from the spirits wash over me. I'd become sensitive to their emotions after all this time together. Even he seemed to feel it; he flinched back just a bit. With a sigh, I relented, undid the chain, and opened the door for him. He straightened his collar and scribbled something on his clipboard before entering the home. \"The city doesn't want this place,\" I told him. \"The foundation is crumbling. I've been meaning to get it fixed myself. Come down to the basement, I'll show you.\" I shuffled over to the side door, where the rickety steps led downstairs. He looked down at his clipboard, then back at me. \"I'd really rather start with the...\" \"Nonsense,\" I interrupted. \"Let's get the worst part over with so you can go back there and tell them to not take my house.\" He sighed and headed through the doorway. I stomped down the stairs after him, and flicked on the light at the bottom. \"What the...\" he managed to get out, before I clubbed him on the back of the head with a heavy wrench from a nearby shelf. He awoke with a start as I splashed cold water across his face. Like the others, he struggled against his bonds almost immediately, with little success. This wasn't my first rodeo; I know how to chain them up properly. The black candles around the circle's perimeter had been lit, filling the room with soft, flickering light. He had been placed on the altar at the center of the pentagram, naked skin against the black stone that somehow remained icy cold even during the muggy summers. I uncovered the book from its hiding place and set it on the altar at the back of the room. From the wall, the Father's spirit emerged. I only ever really saw him during the rituals; he was shy. \"The next offering isn't due for another 7 months,\" he whispered softly. \"What is this one?\" The victim heard it too, and began to moan and squirm. \"There was a bit of an emergency,\" I told him, explaining the situation with the city trying to take the house. With a nod of his pale, ethereal head, the spellbook flipped open and the pages fluttered as if caught in a strong breeze, though there was none. It settled on a page containing the perfect enchantment that would cause them to forget all about this place. \"This should do the trick,\" he said, \"But it does require a blood offering.\" We turned together to look at the victim sobbing on the sacrificial altar. \"Shouldn't be a problem,\" I told him.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nIt was my dream home - a beautiful Victorian architecture with an amazing wrap-around porch and detailed craftsmanship that made it a unique house.

It settled on a page containing the perfect enchantment that would cause them to forget all about this place.\n\n\"This should do the trick,\" he said, \"but it does require a blood offering.\"\n\nWe turned together to look at the victim sobbing on the sacrificial altar.\n\n\"Shouldn't be a problem,\" I told him."}, "t1_ci04nm8": {"original_text": "My friends crowded around me as I sat with a loud sigh with a Sprite in my hands. \"Well?\" They exclaimed. \"What did ya see?\" I grinned. \"Boys, you're looking at the future CEO of Google!\" A chorus of laughter and 'No way!'s filled the air.

Happy birthday,\" says a quiet voice from behind, \"You know its kinda my birthday too? Its my first time out of my house.\" Aron looks at her noticing her curly blonde hair, light brown eyes, and palish skin. He smiles and replies, \"you remind me of my mom,\" after a slight silence and with an almost pitiful facial expression, \"i haven't seen her in eleven years.\" After some shared silence, Aron asks, \"why is this your first day out of your house?\" Ashley responds quickly, \"overly protective parents,\" almost as if it was practiced to stop an emotion from arising. Aron looks at the cloths on her back and the jewelry on her body in silence. Ashley continues as if to hide her obvious realization of Aron, \"I had to literally threaten to kill myself for them to let me out here, on my own lake.\" Aron knew no other response but utter silence. \"Hey, why are you out here alone if its your birthday,\" said Ashley, while just now realizing what her last sentence was.

His dad, on the other hand, was absent, and Aron knew all too well the reason for his father's lack of presence.\n\nThe flashback shifted to Christmas morning when Aron was 13.

I had seen worse, but I had also seen better. The white fur was stained a mud-brown color with blood, and the floppy ears were pulled back to reveal a gruesome head wound. I leaned back in my chair, trying to take it all in. \"So, the old rabbit finally did himself in, huh? I'll miss the bastard, but it was only a matter of time. Those selfish brats made sure of that.\"\n\n\"Not suicide, Sam,\" the captain corrected me. \"Homicide. And I'm putting you in charge of it.\"\n\n\"Homicide?\" I questioned, looking up at the captain. \"Look, Captain, I don't want to believe it any more than you, but the facts are right there. Locked room. No sign of forced entry. Witnesses report no visitors. It's a classic suicide case, cut and dry.\"\n\n\"There's more to this than you know, Sam,\" the captain said, his expression serious. \"But before I start, I want to make it clear that this does not leave my office.\" When I nodded, he slid over another photograph. My gut dropped; this one I wasn't expecting. The green coat was ripped, and the orange hair hung limp over cold, dead eyes. I brushed my feathers over the familiar face. \"When?\"\n\n\"Last night,\" the captain replied. \"Reports have him coming back from the bar around eleven. The landlord found him this morning. I'm sorry about this, Sam. I know you two were close, but there's something else. We found this pinned to Lucky's hat.\" The note read: \"Late, late, late! Did someone lose their white rabbit?\"\n\nI closed my eyes slowly, suddenly realizing why the chief was assigning me this case. \"It can't be him, Cap. He's locked up at The Mills. The only way he's getting out of there is in a box.\"\n\n\"I know,\" the captain said. \"I don't think it's Craving, but the cases are too similar for us to discard the idea of a connection. You know him best, Sam. You're the bird for the job, no questioning it.\"\n\nI said goodbye to the chief and returned to my office. I needed some alone time to think things through, but as I entered, I was greeted by a mass of orange and white fur. I knew I would have to entertain a bit longer. \"Hey, Tony.\"\n\nHe stood up, his feline head almost touching the ceiling. \"How's it been?\"\n\n\"Not great, Sam,\" he replied, sitting back down with a thump. His tail wrapped around the chair leg. \"Snap and Crackle just got picked up again. Possession. I tried to talk to Buzz about easing up on them, but you know him. I was wondering if you could put in a word.\"\n\n\"A crime's a crime, Tony,\" I said, trying to sound firm. \"Buzz is right; we can't keep covering for them forever.\" Even as I said it, I had a bad taste in my beak. The brothers had been through a lot; better guys than them had turned to dust for less. But after three offenses, my wings were tied, and Tony knew that. He had come to my office for more than just that.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said suddenly after a long pause, \"did the chief tell you about Lucky?\"\n\nThere it was. \"Yeah, he told me,\" I replied, leaning back and closing my eyes again. \"It's a shame.

I raised my eyebrow and sighed, not really caring. Normally I'd give a smart counter remark but I was just too tired like I have been for the past year from all the poking and prodding, jostling and bustling, worrying and stressing. Stress. Just the word made my hackles rise. All I wanted right now was the rest and peace my children forced me to find in this hell hole. Luckily, my residing physician, Doctor Lionel, continued before I had the chance to launch into a rant describing my woes; retirement. Jeez, I'm starting to sound like Exterminator. You might as well just take me now, God. I silently prayed before tuning into what the young quack in front of me had to say. \"According to your charts, your blood pressure has improved exponentially. This proves my theory that stress,\" he did not just say that word, \"was the main factor for the elevated levels. Would you not agree, Mrs. Tallison?\" He turned the clipboard he held in his hands to face me. I looked at the series of words and terms that I just didn't have the energy to decipher. \"Sure, right. Is that all for today, Jamie?\" I gave him no time to answer before I turned onto my side with my back toward him and the door. I stared past the empty bed beside me and out the window where the sun was setting with a brilliant farewell. How I miss flying along the same path as the clouds that now paint the sky. I sighed again, wistfully this time, and waited until I heard his footsteps move away and the heavy door shut with a soft click. Finally. That was my final thought before I drifted off into a dream that was only too real not so long ago. Zooming through the night air left a feeling of contentment to settle in the depths of the young woman's womb. She smiled to herself before diving toward the dark ocean water. Once under the waves that formed and tumbled above her, she produced a small air bubble in her hand that held inside a fire to light the darkness around her. She watched as the activity of underwater life woke around her. Fish that were small, large, striped, solid, dull, vibrant, and so much more went about their swimming just as if she weren't there invading their space. She wasn't really. This was her for all intents and purposes. She was the air she flew, the water she swam in, the fire she held, the rock she tread above. This was as much her home as it was theirs. She began to swim toward shore in order to change out of her conforming suit and into her normal clothes. Once there on the soft, white sand of the beach, she noticed a shadow not far from where she left her clothing. With a slow panther prowl in that direction, she was able to sneak up behind the mysterious intruder. Suddenly, the snap of a seashell resounded from under her left hand alerting her guest as to he presence. The figure whipped around to face Elementress revealing his identity as Exterminator, her arch nemesis and Ex-husband. \"Oh, not you.\" Elementress stood and rubbed her still damp palm over her face. He gave a wicked grin. \"Oh, yes. Now, wake up.\" \"Mrs. Tallison, please wake up.\" I startled to wake with my heart almost beating out of my chest. I rubbed the small ache over my heart and looked around in a panic. \"I didn't mean to upset you, ma'am.\" Said a voice from my left. One of the random nightly orderlies stood beside my bed with a suitcase in hand. After calming my racing heart I doubled checked the room to make sure I wasn't in danger and then brought my whole attention to the one who had disturbed my sleep. \"You've got to be kidding me. I could have killed you if I had not been so in control of myself!\" I yelled not even bothering to notice the look of confusion on his chubby, unshaven face. \"Bu-but...\" \"No BUTS! Leave me be!\" I flipped over in order to let him known I was thoroughly finished with this conversation. I heard him almost try to speak again but I summoned my darkest look, turned around, and stared him down until he left with a hurried pace. Once he was gone again, I fell back into a dreamless sleep almost instantly. \"This oatmeal tastes like ass.\" I muttered to the only friend I had managed to make since coming to the God-forsaken place. Tommy the turtle who lived in an aquarium beside the table didn't come out to see the oatmeal I was talking about and instead stayed inside his shell. I didn't blame him. I didn't even know why I bothered coming to the cafeteria anymore. I didn't want to make friends here and all there was is a bunch of old people hobbling around trying to trade their dentures for an extra helping of ass flavored breakfast. I sighed which had now become a common occurrence. I got up and said my goodbyes to Tommy who continued to stay in hiding. On my way to the trash can I bumped into a hard shoulder and sent my tray flying from my hands to the ground. \"I'm sorr-\" \"I'm sorr-\" We both started the apology but didn't finish as soon as our eyes met with sparks of familiarity flaring to life in each others. In that moment, memories ran rampant through my head as I thought about those green eyes and all the times I had gotten hopelessly lost in; the same green eyes I met in kindergarten on the playground when Jimmy Jackson threw rocks at me to try to get me to levitate them, the same green eyes I went to high school prom with and ended up drunkenly kissing for the first time where I then puked into the bush beside the porch immediately after, the same green eyes I married and saw tear up when our children were born, and the same green eyes that glistened with a deep and passionate hate for me only 10 years ago. \"David? What the hell?\" \"Well, hello there to you too, Janet.\" I couldn't think, my brain had checked out of this place like I had wanted to for so long and left me behind with no words to accurately articulate my emotions in that moment. Maybe that's a good thing because Susie Lanson who had probably never cussed in all of her 200 years or so on this planet was currently behind me would probably have died right then and there if I was able to speak. So there I stood with my mouth flopping open and closed with no sound escaping, like a fish out of water searching for the ability to breathe. When I finally felt like enough time had passed where I had made a fool out of myself, I quickly turned about face and started out the door of the cafeteria and to my room, at least there I could avoid him long enough to get my mind right. Once through the threshold of my door and within the confines of my room, I trusted myself to let go. And let go I did. \"EXTERMINATOR? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I know I said I couldn't stand the place and wish I had a little a excitement but this was NOT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!\" I continued to go on with my rather loud monologue with a fire I had not realized I still had because it had gone dull for so long. Once I was done I sat down on my bed with a plop of resignation. \"Well, that was quite the show. Would you like a bullhorn? I'm not sure Australia heard and I would hate for them to have to ask Africa because I'm just not sure how well that would go over.\" I sat up straight and snapped my head toward the door. My eyes grew wide and my breathing sped up. \"What are YOU doing here?\" I asked, rather politely if I do say so myself... Okay, not really. \"Well, I was debating on whether I was going to take a nice nap or play 20 questions with my friendly roommate but, as I can see now, one is difficult while the other is just quite impossible... Mostly because you just aren't friendly.\" I'm surprised my eyes didn't pop out of my skull when I looked over to the once empty bed near the window to see that it now had two suitcases on top of it. \"Wh-wha...\" \"Hello, roomy.\"", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\n\"Still looking good, Janet.\" The tall, blonde-haired doctor looked up from my charts to wink at me with one of his baby blues.

Normally, I'd give a smart counter remark, but I was just too tired, like I had been for the past year, from all the poking and prodding, jostling and bustling, worrying and stressing. Stress. Just the word made my hackles rise. All I wanted right now was the rest and peace my children forced me to find in this hellhole. Luckily, my residing physician, Doctor Lionel, continued before I had the chance to launch into a rant describing my woes; retirement. Jeez, I'm starting to sound like Exterminator. You might as well just take me now, God. I silently prayed before tuning into what the young quack in front of me had to say. \"According to your charts, your blood pressure has improved exponentially. This proves my theory that stress,\" he did not just say that word, \"was the main factor for the elevated levels. Would you not agree, Mrs. Tallison?\" He turned the clipboard he held in his hands to face me. I looked at the series of words and terms that I just didn't have the energy to decipher. \"Sure, right. Is that all for today, Jamie?\" I gave him no time to answer before I turned onto my side with my back toward him and the door. I stared past the empty bed beside me and out the window, where the sun was setting with a brilliant farewell. How I miss flying along the same path as the clouds that now paint the sky. I sighed again, wistfully this time, and waited until I heard his footsteps move away and the heavy door shut with a soft click. Finally. That was my final thought before I drifted off into a dream that was only too real not so long ago.\n\nZooming through the night air left a feeling of contentment to settle in the depths of the young woman's womb. She smiled to herself before diving toward the dark ocean water. Once under the waves that formed and tumbled above her, she produced a small air bubble in her hand that held inside a fire to light the darkness around her. She watched as the activity of underwater life woke around her. Fish that were small, large, striped, solid, dull, vibrant, and so much more went about their swimming just as if she weren't there invading their space. She wasn't really. This was her, for all intents and purposes. She was the air she flew, the water she swam in, the fire she held, the rock she tread above. This was as much her home as it was theirs. She began to swim toward shore in order to change out of her conforming suit and into her normal clothes. Once there, on the soft, white sand of the beach, she noticed a shadow not far from where she left her clothing. With a slow panther prowl in that direction, she was able to sneak up behind the mysterious intruder. Suddenly, the snap of a seashell resounded from under her left hand, alerting her guest as to her presence. The figure whipped around to face Elementress, revealing his identity as Exterminator, her arch-nemesis and ex-husband. \"Oh, not you.\" Elementress stood and rubbed her still-damp palm over her face. He gave a wicked grin. \"Oh, yes. Now, wake up.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Tallison, please wake up.\" I startled to wake with my heart almost beating out of my chest. I rubbed the small ache over my heart and looked around in a panic. \"I didn't mean to upset you, ma'am,\" said a voice from my left. One of the random nightly orderlies stood beside my bed with a suitcase in hand. After calming my racing heart, I double-checked the room to make sure I wasn't in danger and then brought my whole attention to the one who had disturbed my sleep. \"You've got to be kidding me. I could have killed you if I had not been so in control of myself!\" I yelled, not even bothering to notice the look of confusion on his chubby, unshaven face. \"Bu-but...\" \"No BUTS! Leave me be!\" I flipped over in order to let him know I was thoroughly finished with this conversation. I heard him almost try to speak again, but I summoned my darkest look, turned around, and stared him down until he left with a hurried pace. Once he was gone again, I fell back into a dreamless sleep almost instantly.\n\n\"This oatmeal tastes like ass,\" I muttered to the only friend I had managed to make since coming to the God-forsaken place. Tommy the turtle, who lived in an aquarium beside the table, didn't come out to see the oatmeal I was talking about and instead stayed inside his shell. I didn't blame him. I didn't even know why I bothered coming to the cafeteria anymore. I didn't want to make friends here, and all there was is a bunch of old people hobbling around, trying to trade their dentures for an extra helping of ass-flavored breakfast. I sighed, which had now become a common occurrence. I got up and said my goodbyes to Tommy, who continued to stay in hiding. On my way to the trash can, I bumped into a hard shoulder and sent my tray flying from my hands to the ground. \"I'm sorr\u2014\" \"I'm sorr\u2014\" We both started the apology, but didn't finish as soon as our eyes met with sparks of familiarity flaring to life in each other's. In that moment, memories ran rampant through my head as I thought about those green eyes and all the times I had gotten hopelessly lost in; the same green eyes I met in kindergarten on the playground when Jimmy Jackson threw rocks at me to try to get me to levitate them, the same green eyes I went to high school prom with and ended up drunkenly kissing for the first time, where I then puked into the bush beside the porch immediately after, the same green eyes I married and saw tear up when our children were born, and the same green eyes that glistened with a deep and passionate hate for me only 10 years ago. \"David? What the hell?\" \"Well, hello there to you too, Janet.\" I couldn't think; my brain had checked out of this place like I had wanted to for so long and left me behind with no words to accurately articulate my emotions in that moment. Maybe that's a good thing because Susie Lanson, who had probably never cussed in all of her 200 years or so on this planet, was currently behind me and would probably have died right then and there if I was able to speak. So there I stood with my mouth flopping open and closed with no sound escaping, like a fish out of water searching for the ability to breathe. When I finally felt like enough time had passed where I had made a fool out of myself, I quickly turned about face and started out the door of the cafeteria and to my room, at least there I could avoid him long enough to get my mind right. Once through the threshold of my door and within the confines of my room, I trusted myself to let go. And let go I did. \"EXTERMINATOR? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I know I said I couldn't stand the place and wish I had a little excitement, but this was NOT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!\" I continued to go on with my rather loud monologue with a fire I had not realized I still had because it had gone dull for so long. Once I was done, I sat down on my bed with a plop of resignation. \"Well, that was quite the show. Would you like a bullhorn? I'm not sure Australia heard, and I would hate for them to have to ask Africa because I'm just not sure how well that would go over.\" I sat up straight and snapped my head toward the door. My eyes grew wide, and my breathing sped up. \"What are YOU doing here?\" I asked, rather politely if I do say so myself... Okay, not really. \"Well, I was debating on whether I was going to take a nice nap or play 20 questions with my friendly roommate, but, as I can see now, one is difficult while the other is just quite impossible... Mostly because you just aren't friendly.\" I'm surprised my eyes didn't pop out of my skull when I looked over to the once-empty bed near the window to see that it now had two suitcases on top of it. \"Wh-wha\u2014\" \"Hello, roomy.\" }"}, "t1_chcyequ": {"original_text": "Breathe we\u2019re not our skin of grime, we\u2019re not dread bleak dusty imageless locomotives, breathe.

He picked his head up off his desk and stretched his arms into the air. Brent loved napping on his desk. It was just so comfy. As he yawned and opened his eyes, he was greeted with an empty classroom. He looked up ahead at the clock above the whiteboard. 7 PM. \"Aww man, seriously?\" Brent grabbed his bag off the back of his chair and sprinted out the door. How could no one have woken him up? Classes went until 3 and after school clubs let out at 5. There were a number of opportunities for someone to wake him up. He ran down the hall and out the front door. The sun was setting and the street lights had already came on. He started jogging towards his home. His parents were going to be pissed. As he ran, Brent looked around. He knew this was a rather small town but it was odd no one was out. He ran by gas stations still lit up with no one inside, cars still hooked up to gas pumps but no one pumping gas. This was weird but Brent had to get home. He opened the door and threw his bag to the side. \"Mom, Dad I'm back!\" No response. He was expecting them to be waiting for him but nothing. Not even his little sister coming to greet him. He walked into the living room. The television was on ESPN but his dad wasn't in there. Brent was growing worried. He made his way to the kitchen. \"Hey mom is dad out or-\" Brent saw the oven was on but his mom wasn't in the kitchen. He went over to the oven, grabbed a rag and pulled dinner from the oven. The oven was on, the lasagna was still in there, but no one watching it. He set down the hot pan and turned off the oven. He pursed his lips and thought. He left the kitchen and went upstairs. He flung open his parents door. No one. He went to his sisters room. \"Erika!\" Her pink room sat empty, toys strewn about the floor. Brent went took a few steps backwards. He pulled out his phone and called his mom. Did they leave and not let him know? But if they did that why was there still food in the oven? The phone rang but no answer. His dad didn't answer either. He started calling his friends. Sending them texts, waiting for responses. But no one ever answered. He ran in front of his house. \"Hello,\" he shouted into the sky, \"is there anyone here? Hello!\" He heard an owl off in the distance. Brent became frantic. He went from neighbor to neighbor, pounding on there door but getting no response. He ran back to his garage and grabbed his bike. He pedal hard and fast, racing through the streets to get the town square. The square was still lit up. Cars were still parked outside the shops and offices, some cars were still at stop signs and lights. All the shops were still open but like everywhere else, there was no one. Brent was alone. A city that once had a population of three-thousand, had somehow become a population of one. He dropped his bike off in front of a shop and walked over to the gazebo in the park in the middle of the square. He sat down and hung his head. Brent had never felt like this before. This overwhelming sadness. This sense of loneliness. Just a few hours ago, he was in school, surrounded by other students and teachers. His mom had woken him up this morning and he said goodbye to his family when he walked out the door this morning. He had walked by people watering their lawns, people going to work. Suddenly everyone was gone. \"This doesn't have to happen you know.\" Brent's head shot up. There was a woman sitting across from him. She was nude. Brent's eyes widened. A smoking hot naked girl and no one around in the whole town? As strange as it was, he was living his sixteen year old fantasy, and he didn't really care. He stared at her. Her pale skin bathed in the moon light. Her dark hair, draping over her chest. He couldn't stop smiling. He pretended to scratch his nose and tried to look cool. \"Um, miss I think you may want to put some clothes on,\" he pretended to be bashful, \"it gets cold out here at night.\" \"This doesn't have to happen.\" \"No, no! I want this to happen, I'm sorry you're free to do as you please.\" \"Are you not concerned for Erika?\" Brent's eyes narrowed. He stood up, fists clenched. \"How do you know my sister? What the hell is this?\" The woman turned her head, staring off into the distance. \"This doesn't have to happen.\" \"What the hell are you talking about? Where is everyone?\" The nude woman turned her body and pointed into the sky. \"They have been taken. This doesn't have to happen though. You can stop it.\" Brent was taken back. \"What do you mean they were taken? Like abducted by aliens? That doesn't make any sense. Look who are you? What's really happening here?\" She turned back to face Brent. Brent resisted the urge to look down, trying to keep his resolve as solid as possible. This was serious, he didn't need to be taken in by feminine wiles. Then the girl started to walk his way. Brent began stepping backwards. \"Woah, hey. Miss let's pump the brakes for a second, this a serious matter.\" He felt his back of his legs hit the seat behind him and he stopped where he stood. The woman was in front of him now. She was even prettier up close. Her eyes met with his his. She was so close to him. \"Claire.\" \"Okay, Claire. What happened to the town? Can you-\" She hushed him placing a finger over his lips. His heart was beating quickly. Her eyes were still locked on his. \"You can stop this,\" she said again. She leaned in close. Brent had nowhere to run. She started for his neck. He was okay with this. Brent decided to just go with it. He tried as long as he could, this was just going with the flow. He felt her lips on his neck. And then a sharp bite. \"Jesus Christ!!\" \"Mr. Fields,\" Brent looked up and saw his teacher, \"if you're going to sleep in my class, at least have the decency to stay asleep and not interrupt my lecture.\" He looked around the room, his class looked at him. Some looked annoyed by his outburst, while most snickered. He adjusted himself in his seat and cleared his throat. \"I'm sorry about that.\" His teacher glared for a moment then returned to the board. Brent could feel the sweat on his brow. That dream had been so real. And damn what a dream. But still he felt uneasy. \"Hey, Brent.\" Brent looked over at his classmate who sat next to him. \"How'd you get the hickey man,\" he asked gesturing at Brent's neck, \"who you seein'?\" Brent felt at his neck. It hurt. It was still damp. He remembered the dream. At the end, that girl, Claire bit him. Brent swallowed hard. This was strange, and he had a feeling things would only get stranger.

However, the fact that said oligarchy could be tricked into electing me shows just how weak and foolish they have become. How needed this change was. This isn't democracy, folks, not yet. What will emerge? I do not know, but I know this. The cabal of the wealthy who control this country are dead, every last one of them. Along with them are hundreds of representatives, senators, judges, cabinet members, my vice president, and soon, me. I will act as the final sacrificial lamb. There is no one to take my place any time soon. Smaller operations have attempted to destabilize regions and states. This will increase chaos, but its effects are believed to be beneficial in the end. I am sorry for the suffering you will endure, but it was necessary. For my last request, I encourage you to rise up and take back this country and ignore the fear that those in power wish for you to feel. Ignore the numbness they want you to experience towards caring and loving and empathy. Fight against the control of the media and establish something better or...not. It is up to you. The power, finally, is your hands.\" President Obama signs off. No one hears from him again. Crowds loot stores and people run amok, but the chaos begins to lessen and slowly fades away after a few weeks. The United States may no longer exist, but it never really did anyway.

I have had to betray my own country, the place of my birth, and the home I love. I have been labeled a terrorist, but not for the reasons my detractors might expect.

The fact that this oligarchy could be deceived into electing me demonstrates just how weak and foolish they have become, and how necessary this change is.\n\nWhat will emerge from this chaos, I do not know.

Every night is a painful journey in the hallways of thought. I can't help but to think of every little detail of my life that's going wrong right now, and I always wonder whether it's because I fucked up or because of somebody else. I guess my nights aren't so different from my days, then. Though at least during the day I don't have to listen to my creaking and groaning every fucking time I move. I just have to pick the least uncomfortable side to lie on in the least uncomfortable position and not move. Just lie there and wallow in misery and regret. Looking at the wall instead of the ceiling now, though the effect is no different. It doesn't make me feel any less miserable. For a moment, I think that maybe if I could just change the situation somehow, a fresh start or at least a break in the pattern... And then I groan and give my stupid face a slap. That train of thought left the station months ago, and I've been better off without it. It just leads to more misery. It's tantamount to wishing someone would simply swoop in and save me from the sads. It doesn't help. So now I simply lie alone. This is all there is to my life, and that's not going to change anytime soon. Looking to the past, all I see is a blur I'd rather forget. Looking to the future, all I see is fire and brimstone, if you catch my drift. In my current state, I'd liken myself to a lone wolf. I've been wounded and the pack has left me to die. I lick my wounds not because I want to get better, to run and join the pack, but just because my instincts tell me to. I survive simply because I'm too cowardly not to. Not that there'd be anyone who'd miss me or anything. I don't wish I was dead, I wish I wasn't born. I've now lasted another week. Friday has come again. Oh joy. While everyone else is having fun with the onset of the weekend, I'm just sitting in my filthy room, biting my nails while the most inconsequential shit I've ever seen plays on the TV. At this point, I'm actually enjoying the infomertials. Have you ever been so bored and miserable that you enjoyed an INFOMERTIAL? That's a new low. So now I have a decision. Watch another fascinating demonstration of a fucking vacuum cleaner, or take a bath and get drunk. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to anyone that I chose the latter. In my drunken sleep, I dream of me from years and years ago laughing. That used to make me sad... I haven't had a genuine laugh in years. I've laughed, sure, but nothing's funny. It's just a farce. An act so that co-workers won't suspect my misery. All that'll lead to is a load of self help shit or anti-depressants or something. Fuck that. I'll just fake that their stupid jokes are funny and accept that I'll probably never laugh again. So much easier. This is the life I \"chose\". No-one's fault but mine. It makes me wonder how everyone else can be so happy with their lives, their choices. Where did I go wrong, what choice did I make that lead to this? Now I DO wish I was dead. Throw me into the fire and lava and brimstone and let me just burn away. I got out of the tub and cried for the first time in forever. It's been ages since the last time an emotion really grabbed me, and of course it had to be sadness. Grief. Depression. What a stupid idea for me to hold on to that maybe when I broke down the walls I had put up, I might be greeting with happiness, or at least some kind of relief. Ignorant and stupid and selfish. It makes me mad-furious even, to think of how stupid I was. I threw my empty bottle at the wall and it smashed. I looked at the broken glass on the floor. That's what I was. Not even the lone, dying wolf. Just a spray of broken glass. I had once been the bottle, full of potential to do great things, terrible things, full of emotion both good and bad. Everyone liked the bottle. But then the bottle was emptied. No-one wants the empty bottle. It holds nothing for them. No potential, no emotion. The bottle is thrown away and smashed. That is me. On the floor of my bathroom. That's what there is to life. Not lying in a bed feeling sorry for myself. That's the future I look forward to, not fire and brimstone. And even the wolf licking its wounds can't fix something so broken. Like the bottle, there will be no-one who misses me when I'm gone. That lack of laughter means nothing. Had I anything left in me, I might have laughed at how pathetic this all was, but the laughter is gone. It's been long gone and to hell with it. I don't need it anymore. This apartment holds nothing for me. This city holds nothing for me. This world has long since given its last. I climb onto the windowsill and look down at the city below me. That down there, that's my future. With a smile, I let go and once again look at the ceiling. This was a different one, though. This was the roof of everything. I close my eyes. I released myself, and maybe when I open them in the next life, I really WILL be a wolf. And I will look at my pack and know they have my back.

Inside in the back is a laptop with a flash drive attached. The driver gestures to him that this will explain everything, and he should turn it on and watch. The driver also suggests, through gestures, that he pour a glass of the very expensive scotch in the sidebar, because he is going to need it. He pours himself a stiff one. The video is a compilation of CNN News, about a missing airline, and after about three minutes of scenes without information about the flight, the video stops, with this banner on the lower part of the screen. The plane is identified as Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which is the plane the man had been flying on. He poured himself a couple more drinks, and sat there thinking. Somehow he was where the plane went, but he had no idea where he was or where everyone else was. By the time he was at a loss in trying to make sense of the video, the town car was driving at moderate speed through a pine forest. The man banged on the driver's window, and at that the driver stopped the car, got out, and grabbing a heavy backpack from the trunk, the driver dissappeared quickly into the woods. The man was too stunned to follow. He got out and looked around. There was no indication of any lights from any town. The sky was moonless, and there were many stars. The road seemed to run straight in either direction. Thinking that there might be a search for the plane, he gets in the drivers seat, discovers the keys had been left in the car, and turns it around and drives back to the field where the plane had landed. When he gets there the plane is no longer present. Having some experience with computers, he begins to examine the computer itself, as well as other aspects of the car, looking for clues. Thje computer is a model with which he is not familiar, but otherwise responds to his efforts. All the same, it yields up no information. He is getting hungry. There are various noises coming out of the pine woods. A chill wind is picking up, and when he thinks to check the gas gage, he discovers it is nearly empty. He had left the car lights on, and notices a large dog, or perhaps a wolf, is watching him from just beyond the range of the lights. He gets in the town car, and locks the doors. He runs the heater, warming the car, until the engine coughs and dies. He thinks that in the morning something will turn up, suggesting further action. He tries to go to sleep, but mostly tosses and turns and gets cold. When the sun comes up, he starts to look at the woods. He begins to realize that none of the plants, or even the trees look normal to him. He had assumed during the night that this was a pine-tree forest, but the color was off, the needles of the branches were a kind of translucent aqua, and when he touched them they stung, rather sharply, leaving a kind of burn on his fingers. The road, which he had thought of as gravel, was some kind of dirt, but oddly viscus. There was no dust. Then he noticed that the color of the rising sun seemed wrong. He was still cold, and thought to look further, and to warm up by jogging a bit. It took only a few strides to realize that the gravity was less than earthlike. He took a deep breath and noticed the air smelled odd as well. On impulse he popped the hood and discovered that what was there was unlike any engine he had ever seen before. He opened the back door and poured himself another drink. What he had thought of as a kind of odd scotch, he could no longer think of as anything he might have drunk before. Then he sat in the car for a while, sipping this drink, which did give a nice buzz, and could not find any thoughts about what do to. The road was still there, going in a straight line off into the distance, but the car was no longer fueled, and the situation seemed both exciting and hopeless all at once. The conclusion, that he was somehow on another world, was obvious, for he was a fan of science fiction. But, he was also an accountant for a major American owned asian engineering company, so a certain kind of thinking and a bit of scientific knowledge was his. Thinking about his work, reminded him that his family would have been waiting for his flight, which had not arrived. He was surprised he had not before thought of his family. His despair deepened. While he was holding his head in his hands, feeling a need for tears that would not come, he heard a scrapping on the road beside the town car, simliar to the noise his own walking had made on that surface. There was a man standing there. He was wearing something like a monks robe, with the hood thrown back. Except he was not human, although the differences were slight, and once his mind accepted his situation he could no longer deny what his senses revealed. He opened the door and got out of the car. He spoke to the \"alien\": \"There's not much likelyhood, but do you happen to speak English? The \"alien\" laid a six fingered hand on his shoulder and seemed to smile in a sympathetic way, when all of a sudden there were pictures forming in his mind. The alien was able to be telepathic in some way. It took some time for understanding to arise. Most of the morning.

It\u2019s hard to tell with these devices, I\u2019ve made them look so real. \u201cPain is a feeling I was particularly unfamiliar with that day. My life had been so full of people who adored me, I had abundance in wealth, and an endless drive of self-betterment. There was always another mountain to scale, another workday to distract, another snack to enjoy. But on this day, which will forever be engrained in my psyche. It was the day that my life came crumbling apart. It was a day like any other. The sun rose and shone through the slits of the window blinds. The cats, small lovable creatures, swarmed around our feet, meowing for their breakfast. And, beside me was the woman I loved. Her face so sweet as she slept. I prepared our coffee in a French press-\u201c \u201cLike the one we use in the lab?\u201d Lucy asked, her chin pressed between her palms as she sat on the edge of her seat. \u201cThe same.

It would fill two and sometimes three glasses full, the extra I would place in the fridge for iced coffee the next morning \u2014 my favorite.\u201d Lucy smiled. She\u2019d served me iced coffee for years and knew exactly how the press worked, but she did not interrupt.

Her warmth and comforting position was a program but it still felt pleasant. \u201cBeing told you are loved and knowing for certain that they mean it is a line that is often blurred. It is like a blanket that pulls itself over your vision like an abstract illusion. A sheet of endless color and imagination of what could be. But, sometimes the blanket that you weave together is of your own hands and needle and not theirs. When she said she doesn\u2019t love me, that it could never be more than friends. I felt as though the life that pulsed through my veins had stopped. That the threads of this life I had stitched together had come apart with one rip.

Then and every day since, I had assumed the role of the unworthy. The one tossed to the gutter like the rubbish of a fast-food restaurant. My judgement had been clouded, and the control that I believed I had over my world was lost. I was lost.\u201d \u201cYou are not lost here, master. We have found you, sitting before us. Our beautiful, loving God.\u201d I nodded, but the words felt like air against my ears. The same lines of script that had been told to me time and time again. \u201cI drove home to my parents, weeping. What else could I have done but returned to those who birthed me? The place of highest comfort, where I knew at least I would have the pillars of family to keep me from tumbling into the dark abyss. It was there that I receded into what I can only describe as hibernation. A hope that sleep would give birth to an awakened form. One that had regained the control that was lost, or at least one that could see through the illusion so that the pains of the past would not reignite. I was no longer living, Lucy. I was but a husk of the damned shuffling from point-to-point allowing the winds to direct my shambling corpse. The spirit that had once lit a fire of purpose within me had left me, or so I imagined. I was debris, drifting along the surface of the ocean. No purpose. No direction. Just letting the currents take me.\u201d I took one last sip and put the mug on my side-table, empty. \u201cThat does sound terribly sad, but was the loss of everything in the world that came after not a greater sadness? You lost everyone you knew, your family, friends, even your lovable cats. The comet took them all with it. I don\u2019t understand how that would not be a greater loss, a greater sadness.\u201d \u201cAh see, and that is just it Lucy. Those too were a great loss, but it was upon the grave of the life that I had once seen happiness that it had happened. There was nothing to lose in such a dark place.

He felt no small degree of excitement - he knew this would be the biggest day of his entire career. About three minutes ago, something had crashed in front of the home of the President - and nobody really knew what it was. Even in the chaos of the preparation, the agents shared speculation amongst themselves while they raced in and out of rooms, grabbing weapons and armor. Some believed it was a foreign attack - perhaps an artillery shell that had failed to properly detonate. Others believed the object to be an errant component of a malfunctioning aircraft, separated from its fuselage at an inopportune time. Of course, there were those that subscribed to the more fantastical - whispers of extraterrestrial contact echoed softly throughout the halls, not nearly as loud as the other explanations, but never fully drowned out, either. Burrow wasn't sure what to think. Ultimately, he tried not to speculate too much. He had a history of letting his imagination get ahead of himself, and he knew it. Besides, there was no way to really get any valuable information until he saw the object for himself. To that end, he grabbed his pistol, ensured there was ammunition in the magazine, holstered it, and hurried to join those of his associates that were rushing to the front doors of the facility. The sounds of heavy footsteps and heavier breathing surrounded him as he tried to count the number of agents alongside him, a task easier said than done in the chaos of the situation. Three, five, eight... while Burrow could tell it was more than a dozen, it was impossible to get an exact number. It was, however, possible for Burrow to grasp the scope of the operation, and he noted that the response size did not bode well for what he was about to deal with. The higher-ups were scared; that much was obvious. Burrow couldn't help it when his mind wandered back to the rumors and speculation - specifically, the ones that most would find difficult to believe. The concept of an extraterrestrial - an alien \\- arriving on Earth was difficult for Burrow to grasp, but what else would warrant such a strong response? It wouldn't make any sense otherw- No, Burrow chastised himself. It may not make sense to me, but that doesn't mean anything. Just do your job and don't let the others know that you're crazy. With a deep breath, Burrow reached the doors leading outside, where the agents were massing into one large team. He joined it, and together they all burst forth onto the street. It was quite the sight - to his left, Burrow noted policemen in riot gear keeping a quickly growing crowd at bay. Directly ahead, he could spot a heavy police presence in the middle of the street - cruisers with their emergency lights on, parked in a circle and forming a sort of barricade around the source of a massive plume of smoke trailing off into the sky. Officers darted back and forth between the vehicles, some in the front with their firearms drawn, others in the back barking orders. The agent at the head of Burrow's group stopped and turned around, giving a sharp hand signal directed towards the police cars ahead of them. The silence of the agents as they moved, with the exception of their footfalls, served as somewhat of an unnerving contrast to the shouts and clamor emerging from the police and the crowd. As they approached the police vehicles, Burrow's crowd stopped. The head agent said some short words to one of the officers in the back of the blockade, who turned and shouted \"Make way! Let the Service through!\" before four officers jogged off to the side. The leader of Burrow's group raised her weapon and sharply moved her head towards the smoke plume before cautiously yet quickly moving forward. The other agents behind her did the same, including Burrow, who unholstered his pistol, flipped off the safety, and silently followed behind the other agents. When they got through the barricade, they spread out, giving Burrow his first look at the source of the smoke. What he saw almost made his heart stop. The craft was alien; there was no doubt about that. The design was unlike anything that Burrow had ever seen. It was a rather large dark green disk, of sorts - the top featured a cracked dome of glass in the center, which could not be seen into as a result of the inner compartment being saturated with smoke. The dome was attached at the base to what Burrow could only describe as a disk-shaped fuselage; the top surface curved downward towards the bottom of the craft as it extended outward away from the glass dome at the midpoint of the disk's diameter. The fuselage formed a right angle with the ground at its edge, forming a small flat portion that proceeded downwards. The part of the craft furthest away from Burrow billowed smoke up into the sky. Nobody could get a good look at the bottom of the craft; when it landed, it had partially buried itself in the concrete, preventing any detailed examination of the rest of the object. That didn't matter, though - Burrow could tell without a shadow of a doubt that this thing was foreign. Alien. The agents spread out into a line, pointing their weapons at the alien craft. The only sounds that Burrow could hear were the police officers scrambling behind him and his own, rapid heartbeat. The tension was palpable. Nobody dared approach. Suddenly, steam shot out from under the glass dome, letting out a loud hissing sound. Burrow's heart skipped a beat. The dome slowly opened in a way that reminded Burrow of the launcher closer door of a missile silo. Smoke poured out from inside, although Burrow still couldn't see through it. He noticed his pistol quivering, as were the hands that held it. The dome stopped when it reached a right angle with the road. As more smoke poured out of the dome's compartment, more of the interior became visible. Burrow could now make out a control panel - or series of control panels - lining the inside. He made note of levers, buttons, keyholes, and other apparatuses that he couldn't quite place. Eventually, the smoke thinned enough to see... Burrow nearly dropped his firearm, and he heard a gasp from the agent next to him. There, in the middle of the smoke, was the unmistakable silhouette of a standing humanoid creature. It took a step forward. Burrow's mind raced. What would this creature look like? Sound like? What was its culture? How would they communicate? Did this thing even talk in a way that he would be able to recognize? What would this mean for the planet at large? The alien took another step, and Burrow forcefully put the breaks on his runaway train of thought. He took a deep breath and stabilized the weapon in his hands. There would be time to ask those questions, but now wasn't it. Humankind was about to make first contact with real, true alien life - and he was going to be on the front lines. The silhouette moved again, and some of the smoke cleared. It moved again, and Burrow caught what seemed to be an arm briefly emerge from the smoke before retreating back into it. He took another deep breath, and double checked to make sure the safety was off on his pistol. Time almost seemed to stop as he saw the alien take the final step out of the smoke... ...and his jaw dropped when a roughly 60 year-old Caucasian male casually strolled onto and across the hull of the craft, and then down onto the street.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nAgent Burrow's heart raced as he and his coworkers in the Secret Service scrambled to gather their equipment.

Officers darted back and forth between the vehicles, some in the front with their firearms drawn, others in the back barking orders.\n\nThe agent at the head of Burrow's group stopped and turned around, giving a sharp hand signal directed towards the police cars ahead of them. The silence of the agents as they moved, with the exception of their footfalls, served as an unnerving contrast to the shouts and clamor emerging from the police and the crowd. As they approached the police vehicles, Burrow's group stopped. The head agent said some short words to one of the officers in the back of the blockade, who turned and shouted \"Make way! Let the Service through!\" before four officers jogged off to the side.\n\nThe leader of Burrow's group raised her weapon and sharply moved her head towards the smoke plume before cautiously yet quickly moving forward. The other agents behind her did the same, including Burrow, who unholstered his pistol, flipped off the safety, and silently followed behind the other agents. When they got through the barricade, they spread out, giving Burrow his first look at the source of the smoke.\n\nWhat he saw almost made his heart stop. The craft was alien; there was no doubt about that. The design was unlike anything Burrow had ever seen. It was a rather large dark green disk, of sorts \u2013 the top featured a cracked dome of glass in the center, which could not be seen into as a result of the inner compartment being saturated with smoke. The dome was attached at the base to what Burrow could only describe as a disk-shaped fuselage; the top surface curved downward towards the bottom of the craft as it extended outward away from the glass dome at the midpoint of the disk's diameter. The fuselage formed a right angle with the ground at its edge, forming a small flat portion that proceeded downwards. The part of the craft furthest away from Burrow billowed smoke up into the sky. Nobody could get a good look at the bottom of the craft; when it landed, it had partially buried itself in the concrete, preventing any detailed examination of the rest of the object. That didn't matter, though \u2013 Burrow could tell without a shadow of a doubt that this thing was foreign. Alien.\n\nThe agents spread out into a line, pointing their weapons at the alien craft. The only sounds Burrow could hear were the police officers scrambling behind him and his own rapid heartbeat. The tension was palpable. Nobody dared approach. Suddenly, steam shot out from under the glass dome, letting out a loud hissing sound. Burrow's heart skipped a beat. The dome slowly opened in a way that reminded Burrow of the launcher closer door of a missile silo. Smoke poured out from inside, although Burrow still couldn't see through it. He noticed his pistol quivering, as were the hands that held it.\n\nThe dome stopped when it reached a right angle with the road. As more smoke poured out of the dome's compartment, more of the interior became visible. Burrow could now make out a control panel \u2013 or series of control panels \u2013 lining the inside. He made note of levers, buttons, keyholes, and other apparatuses that he couldn't quite place. Eventually, the smoke thinned enough to see... Burrow nearly dropped his firearm, and he heard a gasp from the agent next to him. There, in the middle of the smoke, was the unmistakable silhouette of a standing humanoid creature. It took a step forward.\n\nBurrow's mind raced. What would this creature look like? Sound like? What was its culture? How would they communicate? Did this thing even talk in a way that he would be able to recognize? What would this mean for the planet at large? The alien took another step, and Burrow forcefully put the brakes on his runaway train of thought. He took a deep breath and stabilized the weapon in his hands. There would be time to ask those questions, but now wasn't it. Humankind was about to make first contact with real, true alien life \u2013 and he was going to be on the front lines.\n\nThe silhouette moved again, and some of the smoke cleared. It moved again, and Burrow caught what seemed to be an arm briefly emerge from the smoke before retreating back into it. He took another deep breath and double-checked to make sure the safety was off on his pistol. Time almost seemed to stop as he saw the alien take the final step out of the smoke... ...and his jaw dropped when a roughly 60-year-old Caucasian male casually strolled onto and across the hull of the craft, and then down onto the street."}, "t1_cnks04q": {"original_text": "My first response.

The price tag hanging off of this job, however, quickly made me change my tune. \u201cMy employer will pay you 20 million US dollars to make a program for her.\u201d The mysterious messenger said. Seemed simple enough, but I needed more information than that. \"I need specifics. I can\u2019t take a job based on the number of zeros. If I did that, I\u2019d be arrested within a week.\u201d I replied, trying to sound disinterested. \u201cYou\u2019ll receive the details once you accept the job. Take it or leave it.\u201d He retorted. This clearly wasn\u2019t optional. Nobody offers 20 million to a hacker with any intention of letting them live if they refuse. \u201cI figured you\u2019d go for that one guy down in Chicago that broke the firewalls on that fancy new OS shit\u2019s hooked up to.\u201d I said, trying to see why they picked me instead of anybody else. His response came quickly and without any obvious signs of bullshit. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short. We know that you are the most qualified to do this job. That guy in Chicago would become more of a liability in the end. But you have no loyalty. You simply follow the money. We need that.\u201d So this was a black hat job. I hadn\u2019t done one of these since I nearly got caught three years ago. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll do it. When do I learn what I\u2019m making?\u201d Time to visit the wardrobe, I guess. \u201cWe\u2019ll contact you. From now until completion, you talk to no one. You don\u2019t leave the house. If you need something, order it online. You\u2019ll have 20 million to throw around once you\u2019re done.\u201d He responded, terminating the connection. This was going to be interesting. The specifics came in about three days later. I was to make a program that used a fast mutating algorithm to predict when certain events would occur. The event type would be told to me once the first part was done. Seemed simple enough. I had done stuff like this before for wall street types looking for an edge. Was always fun to see them get arrested on live TV because I ratted them out. Rivals pay very well for that type of information. The first part went off very simply, and I got it done within a day. I sent word to the messenger that I was ready for the second part of the job, hoping it would be that easy. \u201cThe types of events we want you to predict are political shifts. Not small ones like your local representative changing his view on a bean farmer\u2019s tax. We want major leadership changes.\u201d The messenger replied, dashing all hopes I had of an easy paycheck. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about predicting when a coup could be possible.\u201d I took a wild stab in the dark, hoping to get some more information to refine the program. There was a split second of delay in his response. \u201cIn a way, yes. Can you do that?\u201d The question was very clearly rhetorical. If I don\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t live to see the next day. \u201cYes, I can. When do you need it done by?\u201d I replied, content with knowing the specifics. \u201cThere is no hard time limit. We would prefer it to be done by March.\u201d So I had half a year, but his response made it clear that every day past March meant a large dock in pay. I waited a second before replying. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll get started.\u201d The coding of the second half of this program was not easy. It took me weeks to get the basics finished. The advanced parts took even longer. The fine tuning made me come extremely close to the deadline, and I was starting to worry if I would make it in time. But on February the 27th, I finally finished it. All the bugs ironed out, the glitches removed. It was the finest piece of coding I had ever made. I contacted the messenger, and he connected me to the woman that hired me. We didn\u2019t share names. She began the conversation. \u201cI am pleased to see that you came through on this. The money will be wired to your offshore accounts within the week.

However, the price tag attached to this job quickly changed my tune. \"My employer will pay you 20 million US dollars to create a program for her,\" the mysterious messenger said. It seemed simple enough, but I needed more information than that.\n\n\"I need specifics,\" I replied, trying to sound disinterested. \"I can't take a job based on the number of zeros. If I did that, I'd be arrested within a week.\"\n\n\"You'll receive the details once you accept the job. Take it or leave it,\" he retorted. This clearly wasn't optional. Nobody offers 20 million to a hacker with any intention of letting them live if they refuse.\n\n\"I figured you'd go for that guy down in Chicago who broke the firewalls on that fancy new OS,\" I said, trying to see why they picked me instead of anyone else. His response came quickly and without any obvious signs of deception. \"Don't sell yourself short. We know that you are the most qualified to do this job. That guy in Chicago would become more of a liability in the end. But you have no loyalty. You simply follow the money. We need that.\"\n\nSo this was a black hat job. I hadn't done one of these since I nearly got caught three years ago.\n\n\"Alright, I'll do it,\" I said. \"When do I learn what I'm making?\"\n\n\"We'll contact you,\" he responded. \"From now until completion, you talk to no one. You don't leave the house. If you need something, order it online. You'll have 20 million to throw around once you're done.\"\n\nThe specifics came in about three days later. I was to create a program that used a fast-mutating algorithm to predict when certain events would occur. The event type would be told to me once the first part was done. It seemed simple enough. I had done stuff like this before for Wall Street types looking for an edge. It was always fun to see them get arrested on live TV because I ratted them out. Rivals pay very well for that type of information.\n\nThe first part went off very smoothly, and I got it done within a day. I sent word to the messenger that I was ready for the second part of the job, hoping it would be that easy.\n\n\"The types of events we want you to predict are political shifts,\" the messenger replied. \"Not small ones like your local representative changing their view on a bean farmer's tax. We want major leadership changes.\"\n\nI took a wild stab in the dark, hoping to get some more information to refine the program. \"You're talking about predicting when a coup could be possible.\"\n\nThere was a split second of delay in his response. \"In a way, yes. Can you do that?\"\n\nThe question was very clearly rhetorical. If I didn't do it, I didn't live to see the next day.\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" I replied, content with knowing the specifics. \"When do you need it done by?\"\n\n\"There is no hard time limit,\" he said. \"We would prefer it to be done by March.\"\n\nSo I had half a year, but his response made it clear that every day past March meant a large dock in pay. I waited a second before replying.\n\n\"Alright, I'll get started.\"\n\nThe coding of the second half of this program was not easy. It took me weeks to get the basics finished. The advanced parts took even longer. The fine-tuning made me come extremely close to the deadline, and I was starting to worry if I would make it in time. But on February 27th, I finally finished it. All the bugs ironed out, the glitches removed. It was the finest piece of coding I had ever made.\n\nI contacted the messenger, and he connected me to the woman who hired me. We didn't share names. She began the conversation.\n\n\"I am pleased to see that you came through on this,\" she said. \"The money will be wired to your offshore accounts within the week. Any questions now that we have completed business?\"\n\nShe had a very authoritative tone that made me wary of asking anything.\n\n\"Well, assassins say that at the right time and place, a knife can topple an empire,\" I responded. \"My computer program can accurately tell you those times and places.

My name is Garcia, it means \"Mighty with a spear\" and I suppose that's what this is all about. My spear is an 80 meter pole I found washed up on the edges of my island, Puerto Rico. I suppose I'm writing this with too much pride though, so let me start from the beginning. After the damage to the island in 2017 and the failed attempts to get a functional power grid back online and the general lack of food, shelter, or even drinking water there was much to be done on the island. By mid-2018 the Trump presidency - as well as the majority of aid organizations- had forgotten about us. 'peqgroupos' or little groups began to form. They're like little communities of families that all work together to provide the necessities, where each member has a job. My job was to man the HAM radio and communicate with the fishing boats and any aid volunteers that did come. Fortunately for my peqgroupo one of the other families was Cuba and had experience making everything from nothing, and had spent years learning how to work with electronics and vacuum tubes from his bisabuelo. He was able to bring me from 10 watts to 100 watts, and made the signal quality both for transmission and reception much better. If I set things up right I could do moon-bounce pretty well even, not that we had a use for it. About halfway though 2020 is when I found the large pole on the beach, and with help from all of the peqgroupo, got it set up and attached to a larger transmitter salvaged from a pirate radio station from the Virgins, and with that and the now semi-functional power grid I was at 10,000 watts. When the power grid could handle it I was the voice of the island. Sure, the sound quality was marginal at best, even though the best of AM radios, but the island had music again. I felt like a God. I put on any music I could find, and at least once an hour broadcast a message asking for aid. By new years this year (2021) the island had practically claimed independence, and the attitude had swayed to not wanting help. To knowing that we could do better on our own. Sure, we still had a worthless head in the house, but excluding that we had our nation back. We were Puerto Rico. February, 3 months ago, was the first time I heard it. It sounded vaguely like English, but like none that I had ever heard. I was tuned to 111.11 scanning though when I picked it up. I decided to transmit back. \"Hello? Hola?\" the transmission continued for about 10 minutes until suddenly it erupted, what must've been 50 distinct voices came in, all in this foreign language, and then there was a massive static burst followed by one voice which said something yet again in an unknown language, but with an inquisitive tone. With out an idea what I was getting into I responded \"Who is this? Quien es este? Quien? Quien?\". A silent 10 minutes passed, before I heard one word repeated multiple times \"Atlantis. Atlantis. Atlantis.\" I tried talking to the station again but it was silent. The next day I tuned to the same station again, but this time the same message was playing on repeat. \"This is Atlantis. This is Atlantis. We not did thought any survivors. On way. 10 days. 10 days.\" I responded quickly. \"Hello Atlantis. What is your location?\" The same message repeated multiple times before going silent for about half an hour. I waited in fear that the survivors message implied they were in need. Finally I heard \"Vega. 10 days. 25 year light.\" repeat twice, and then once more as \"Vega. 10 dia. 25 a\u00f1o luz\" and then stop, as if waiting for a reply. I thought for a moment. The English was broken, and the distance, 25 light years, surly someone must be messing with me. I decided to tune away from the frequency and continue my music broadcasts. Ten days later it came. Atlantis, the lost city, was not lost to the sea, but rather to the stars. it landed in the water about an 1/4 mile from the island. At least we assume it landed, since it was simply there in the morning. As we gathered on the beach we saw the side of the craft - a large bubble, so large it absorbed the horizon- open up and on the inside was an entire city, and on this edge a large crowd of people stood there cheering, as if they had just won the super bowl. Even from this distance the sound was overwhelming. The entire craft came this way. The passengers were human. I am Garcia, the man who brought Atlantis home with my spear, and with it the cure to all of our diseases and cancers, the solution to our - and the world's - energy needs, and so, so much more. We have reunited with our Gods to find that we are Gods ourselves. Atlantis was a city of engineers, scientists, and hope. They brought us libraries that would've made Alexandria look like a rural middle school book club's trash pile, and foods that we could have never imagined. So how about that America?

She was a breath of fresh air in a forest, and I felt like I had lived in a city my whole life.\n\nAlmost always, she smelled like butterscotch. She told me it reminded her of home. In time, that was home to me, too. I asked the bartender for another drink, avoiding his eyes. Aside from telepathy, I've always had a good sense when someone was disapproving of me. Maybe it was from all the teachers who thought I was nothing but a cheater. Maybe it was from the friends I had lost because they thought I was too awkward to be with them. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. There's a lot I don't know.\n\nThe day she left was May 3rd, the first warm day of the year. I still keep track of these things. But I don't remember what she wore. I don't remember what I wore, either. She was carrying a copy of Crime and Punishment under her arm. I don't remember where her bookmark was. I can't recall the way her hair fell across her shoulders because I was too busy looking at her hands. When I met her eyes, I saw radio static. Do you know what radio static looks like? I didn't say goodbye until after she shut the door. It was like that. It was like losing all senses except hearing.

Only tragedies.\" There was a knock at the door. A rail thin man in an oversized suit and comb over peeked through the window to the room. I nodded for him to enter. \"Evening,\" he said. \"My name is Frank Otten, from the Office of Destiny Affairs. I'm here to talk options for your son there.\" He noisily scraped a chair from the opposite side of the room and sat next to me, with a smile on his face that can only be described as bureaucratic. \"My my, look at that hair. He's a protagonist, no doubt about it. We see two or three a year here lately. Used to be that you'd go decades between them, but since that second moon showed up, well, we've been busy.\" \"We've had a long day,\" Ruth began to protest. \"I know,\" Frank interrupted, raising both hands apologetically. \"I know. And you have a lot to think about. But these things don't wait until you're ready. They just happen, and so we need to go through the paperwork immediately. I'm sorry.\" He pulled a binder out of his satchel and licked his index finger before opening it and flipping through the pages. \"It says here that he's marked with a spiral on his shoulder. Is that right or left?\" \"Left,\" I answered. \"I see. Do either of you have any royal lineage? No? What about ancient curses? Father or grandfather ever open up a tomb or desecrate a--\" \"No,\" Ruth interrupted, loudly. \"Ok. Ok. That leaves us with options, at least. Royal lineage, that's a bad hand. You basically die immediately. Curses, well, those never end well for anybody. But you two are lucky.\" \"We don't feel lucky.\" He sighed. \"No, sir, no I don't imagine you do. Now, this isn't a science. In fact it's quite the opposite, isn't it? But based on previous protagonists we can map some likely paths for you and your son. The first option is to leave him at the foot of a mountain upon which there must be a monastery. I have a list here if you're interested. Closest one is in Old Detroit. That mountain popped up after the Second Cataclysm. The forest around it is infested with lizard rats but the monastery itself is quite nice.\" \"No,\" Ruth said quickly. She pulled our boy in closer, putting her nose to his forehead. \"What's a lizard rat?\" I asked, trying to deflect the conversation, to delay the inevitable for just a moment longer. \"Well it's just like a rat except it has scales and the legs of a deer and saber teeth.\" I tried my best to be incredulous, to pretend to be anything other than numb. \"Have you ever seen a rat?\" \"Stop it!\" Ruth screamed. \"Just stop it, Trav. I know what you're doing. You always do this. Just stop.\" The silence that filled the room felt like the air before a storm. I could feel a small part of me fail, the part that held back all the dread and the fear and the helpless anger. It all came rushing in like floodwater. I shot up from my chair, flipping it over in the process, and stood by the window so Ruth couldn't see my tears. \"The second option is for you to be taken. The overlord who currently runs the western provinces of Canada has an enslavement program for the parents of protagonists. There's a small form to fill out, after which you'll be abducted and transported to one of his mining camps. This is a good option, as the story may revolve around your son attempting to rescue you.\" \"Where does his story lead from the monastery?\" I asked. \"Nowhere,\" Ruth answered. \"None of these stories go anywhere. We're not giving him up.\" \"Ma'am,\" Frank said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"If you do not forfeit your child to his destiny, you will die. There's never been a protagonist whose parents survive. As soon as he can barely take care of himself, you will meet a violent end, and it is likely that he will witness this.\" She tried to talk, but all that came out was a guttural sob. Her whole body convulsed with each cry, each whimper that escaped her mouth. Our son, our only boy, destined to lose us, to make his way alone in a horrible world and then meet his own end in some distant, bloody place. That's how every protagonist went, violent, scared, and alone, and afterwards the world just gets a little worse. Every one of them sacrificed just pushes us further into hell. \"I won't do it,\" I said finally. Somewhere in me, something woke, something deep but bright. Suddenly there was a fire in me. \"I don't care about destiny. I don't care about dark lords or overlords or whatever the hell else is in your binder. I'm not giving my son to this hell!\" Frank rose from his seat suddenly, flipped a few pages and ran his finger down in search of something. \"I see,\" he muttered. \"Very well.

As a tech on a mining ship, I tried to stay out of the way of the people who mattered - the ones who didn't have black grime caked under their fingernails like I did.\n\nFirst, I noticed the smell of popcorn, and then I felt a strange force in my head. I brought my hands up to my face to take a look, and the tips of my fingers seemed to melt into long lines that extended into my mind. That's the best way I can describe it. I apologize if it doesn't make sense.\n\nNext, there was a flickering sensation, and the men around me screamed silently. Then, they began to float away from me. I reached out to them, but my hand only extended deeper into my mind. There was an explosion of colors - all of them at once. I saw brief flashes of stars all around me. I know it sounds silly, but I saw the dog from my childhood.\n\nAt this point, I realized I was crying. I knew this because I was looking at myself from above. I looked up and saw myself reflected in the ceiling of the ship, looking right back down at me. I smiled, and my reflection smiled back. The popcorn smell began to burn, and the colors slowly melded into a soft red. The stars moved far away until they were only a few points in the absolute blackness around me. Screams echoed all around me. I realized my eyes were closed, so I opened them to see the flight deck in disarray, with all the men exhibiting different forms of terror. A few clawed at their faces like madmen, while others looked shell-shocked. Me? I was laughing.\n\nI watched myself from the seat opposite me, chuckling at first and then losing it completely. I looked up and met eyes with my reflection. The other side of the ship quickly folded inwards upon itself. Both versions of me held our arms up in defense and slammed into each other. It was nothing for a while. This is where things get hazy. And then I was born. And then I died."}, "t1_djde19a": {"original_text": "Every night I stare at the moon through my window.

Though I was overall fixed in position, my mid-section could still twist side to side upon the chair. I had tried lunging forward when I was first strapped in, but the brace around the front of my neck bruised my hyoid and put a quick end to that venture. With my back tight against the chair and only my eyes being free to move, I began to look around the room. There wasn\u2019t much in terms of d\u00e9cor, as I faced a blank white wall without a door. Above my head was a metal contraption with a chin strap, similar to that of some archaic electric chair. If I really strained my sight to the left, I could see a similar chair to mine with several pipes and cords running between the matching set. It was only a matter of time until they lowered it on top of me and began their experiment. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, but I remember promises of making me better looking and poised before I passed out. Where was I before this? The bar\u2026 I think. It\u2019s a little hazy to be honest. The big guy sitting at the table in front of me has been no help at all. He barely bothers to look over from the newspaper in his hands, much less respond to me pleas for help. Nope. He just casually sat there with his feet up on the table and a pistol holstered just under his right shoulder. He may as well of been waiting for his wife to bring breakfast with that exhibition of ease, though I\u2019m sure his wife would probably slap him upside the head for ignoring a guest in such a manner. Suddenly, the man set the newspaper down on the desk and pulled back his suit sleeve to check the time. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I questioned, \u201cWhat is it time for!?!\u201d The man got up and made his way around the table toward me. \u201cWait\u2026 no\u201d, I continued, \u201cStay away\u2026\u201d He swiftly made his way over, I flinched and closed my eyes when he reached my side in fear he was about to harm me. Upon reopening my eyes, I noticed that he\u2019d walked right on by me. I could he him tinkering from behind. \u201cNo, no\u201d, I exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s just hold on a \u2013 \u201c The man interrupted my plea by stuffing a sock in my mouth and then covering it up with a gag ball on a strap. I could hear my muffled screams as he lowered the metal cap down onto my head. Moments later I could hear a door swing open behind me, followed be several emerging footsteps. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d A smooth, deep voice questioned behind me. \u201cTake a look for yourself, agent Black\u201d, a bland voice replied. The steps continued and then emerged a suave looking gentleman from my right side. He dressed from head to toe in a fine designer suit with impeccable fit and taste. He walked to my front, followed by a man in a white lab coat with glasses. The suave gentleman leaned in close to my face, his eyes were a nice hazel brown and his hair was stylishly gelled back and to the side. \u201cSorry, mate\u201d, the man exclaimed, \u201cThey seemed to have you in a rather poor state here I see\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, they seem to treat most our guest this way.\u201d He followed this with a big smirk and laugh, looking over at the man in the lab coat. He didn\u2019t reciprocate the gesture, but I heard a quick crackle to my right and noticed the same large man from earlier leaning his hand against my chair. The man in the lab coat looked off the large gentleman to my right before proclaiming, \u201cAgent Black, please don\u2019t make light of the situation\u2026 it\u2019s only that more degrading to our test subjects.\u201d Agent Black turned his back toward me and faced the man in the lab coat, who was now making his way around the table to where the large man was siting before. I noticed the large man to my right start inching closer to the agent, another large man emerging from my left doing the same. \u201cWhat exactly are you testing, Dr. Malvern?\u201d the agent questioned. \u201cWell your cover was blown, Agent Black\u201d, Dr. Malvern began to respond as the agent finally took note of the two large men now standing to either side of him, \u201cSo\u2026 we\u2019re going to put your mind in this man and then send you back out to the field.\u201d The agent looked over his shoulder at me before pointing his finger and then refocusing his eyes onto Dr. Malvern. \u201cYou\u2019re going to put me in him?\u201d he questioned, \u201cAnd then send me back out to the field?\u201d \u201cPrecisely\u2026\u201d Dr. Malvern replied, \"The Soviet don't know who this guy is... barely anyone does honestly.\" The agent began looking around frantically to the four faces placed on every side of him. I began to shake and yell through the gag again, now understanding exactly what was going on. \u201c\u2026But\u201d, the agent began to protest, \u201cI\u2019ve been going for eight years now\u2026 I was hoping to go home and see my family. Haven\u2019t I earned that much?\u201d \u201cI agree, you\u2019ve earned very much during your time\u201d, Dr. Malvern replied, \u201cFor instance, you\u2019ve earned a complete understanding of the entire inner working of the KGB\u2026 and we need you to continue doing so.\u201d The agent quickly threw backhanded fist toward the face of the man to his left, but the large gentleman grabbed him by the wrist and then delivered a blow to his left side. The agent then flailed toward the man to his left, but the other large gentleman had already grabbed his left arm and pinned it behind his back. The two men then dragged him to my left, the agent flailing his feet all the while. They pinned him down into the seat and began strapping him in one limb at a time. The agent spit into the face of the large man pinning him down from the front, and the man countered by punching him right in the nose. The other man was now standing behind the chair and secured the brace around the agent\u2019s neck. The two men then continued tightly fastening every strap as the agent slumped in the chair and slightly held his head back. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll take orders from you after this\u201d, the agent wailed, \u201cYou\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u201d Dr. Malvern crossed in front of me and made way over toward the agent, chuckling as he went along. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ways to get you working\u201d, Dr. Malvern replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a family\u2026 a wife and two kids.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u201d \u201cBut I would\u2026 and if I don\u2019t, then someone else would\u201d, Dr. Malvern replied sternly as he leaned in close to the agent, \u201cBesides\u2026 we\u2019ve developed ways to control you, agent.\u201d Dr. Malvern backed away and made his way around the table once again. He proclaimed before sitting down in his chair, \u201cThis machine is for more than just transferring minds\u2026 you see, it comes with the added benefit of controlling them as well.\u201d \u201cDamn yo \u2013 \u201c, the agent began to wail before he was muffled in a similar manner as I was. With that, one of the large men walked to the side of the table next to Dr. Malvern while the other man stayed out of site somewhere behind. \u201cPull the switch\u201d, Dr. Malvern exclaimed. Every muscle and cell in my body tensed up and then began to quiver. It felt like being shook in a small jar of water that was simultaneously being electrocuted. My vision switched from the white of the ceiling, to yellow splotches, until it finally settled on darkness when my eyes rolled to the back of my head.

A stream carved its way through the mountains giving everything around here a chance. Riku was a Sergeant in the Self Defence Force of Japan. That always made him laugh, Self Defence Force. Yet they were on foreign soil, being able to set up an outpost on the Northeast Shore of Australia. They called it the Northern Territory, at least that was what Intel labelled it as. They were sent to set up, a forward base before attacking the city of Darwin. Riku was leading his small squad on a scouting mission into the bush. The five man team hadn't ventured this far as they made their way down to a river. \"What is it Reo?\" Asked Riku, as he turned back to the rest of the squad. \"Tracks.\" He responded. Riku paced over quickly to Reo. Human tracks? No it couldn't be this far out, no sane person would ever live out here. As he looked over the tracks, it was clear they weren't human. Whatever they were was big, it looked like an oversized chicken. \"Boss.\" The eager and happy sounding voice Haruno broke the concerntration of Reo and Riku as they looked down studying the tracks. They looked up to see Haruno standing several meters ahead of thenm holding a rather large egg as he stood beside a nest. \"Chickens\" Riku smiled getting back to his feet. His parents had always had chickens around when he was growing up. They were wonderful, and he always loved to see them. Chickens this big though, well that would be a sight. One he could tell his parents all about. Then it happened. It was fast, too fast. Haruno was standing there for a moment and then he was in two. This large grey bird tore through Haruno in seconds with its large powerful foot. Riku had heard a lot about the dangers of Australia. Snakes, Spiders, this monster that lurked beneath the waters of rivers. Nothing.. nothing compared to the monster that stood before them. This oversized bird like creature was 6 foot tall had just eviscerated a human with one strike and now looked at the four men left standing. \"Bastard!\" Reo yelled as he pulled his rifle up to take aim at the large bird. His bullets tore through the air and into the large bird as it began to charge at him. The bird launched forward on its two strong legs, driving it's foot into Reo. Reo was smart enough to block it with his rifle, although he still had two large gashes in his chest from the claws on its feet. The bird was close and in between Riku and Ai now. Ai was more veteran, senior. He didn't care what this thing was, he was ready to put it down. He took a precise shot, aiming for its small head. At this range though, the creature stood no chance. His rifle had down its job. The large feathered beast fell to the ground with a thud. Neidama quickly ran to Reo who was crying out in pain. Riku had a moment, a second to collect himself and survey the scene. There was Reo, in pain, injured. There was, Haruno. At least what was left of him. His body in two halves, yet his hands still clasp the egg. An egg, this was a nest, they had stumbled upon. \"Spread out!\" Riku called out, but it was too late. The bushes around then rustled, the group was set upon by more of the large birds. They were blindingly fast, and powerful enough to disembowel a man with one kick. The first to fall was Daichi, then the creatures got to Neidama and Reo. Ai was more prepared. He was able to put down another creature before he fell. Riku took to cover quickly, collapsing down against a fallen tree as he heard the scurrying of feet and the calling out of pain, until it stopped.

Our town was an exit on the Interstate, and that kept enough traffic to keep places like the local fast food and 3 gas station/convenience stores in business. The Grill (So clever, right?) as they call it, started out as a breakfast and lunch place in one of the gas stations. Then, the others started showing up at night. They wanted food, but not roller taquitos of dubious origin or age, but fresh food. They were very persuasive in getting Bob the overnight assistant manager/keyholder to fire up the grill, but he really sucked at cooking So, one evening, a gentleman showed up at the fast food place where I worked evenings after school and ordered a huge order of food. I got everything together as quick as I could and made sure I didn't screw up on any of the details. My manager took note of everything I did, and promptly fired me and handed me a note saying I was to go up the street to the gas station with The Grill inside and work for them. He even paid me out what he owed me for the week in cash right there. His eyes had a strange look to them, but I didn't question the cash part and went home. I showed up at \"The Grill\" the next night. Bob the night manager looked at me and asked me what I wanted. I handed him the note. His face turned pale and he said, \"Oh, it's you they found. You cooked for them last night. I 'm really glad you're here. Fill out this form to get you set up in our payroll system, and your wage is filled in there.\" He pointed to a spot on the form. It was triple the current minimum wage! \"Wow! Thanks Bob! Had I known you paid this well, I would have come here long before now!\" I remarked as I filled in all of my information. \"We normally DON'T. You're making more than I do, kid. However, when they insist, you find that you cannot disobey.\" He shuddered. \"You shouldn't even try to disobey them. Just do what they ask of you and you'll be fine. But don't, like, talk to them, or bother them. Especially don't bother them.\" His hand was shaking as he took the clipboard with filled in paperwork from me. So that's how I met... Well, it's hard to explain. I call them, the old guys. They are... hard to focus on sometimes. But that's okay. They have always been super nice to me. Well, that I remember. I tried to have a conversation with the one who got me the job here and he initially didn't understand why I was talking to him. He asked me if I was not like the others on this plane, because I could look at him without running away screaming. Which I thought was hilarious. I mean, we aren't on a plane, we are in a restaurant, right? It wasn't like he was hideous. He was just this old man, like the others. Bob would often pull me aside when I would go check on them at their tables and refill their drinks or ask if they wanted anything else to eat and tell me I was tempting fate by talking to them. I think he was afraid that I would run them off by being too friendly or be seen as nosey. Most of the time, I couldn't even understand them as they talked to each other in like Ukrainian or maybe some form of an Asian language. It had weird syntax and the sounds were not like what we used in English. One night, they brought a book and were passing it around and discussing it in their conversations. It was really old. Then someone pulled out a paperback book from their jacket pocket and was comparing the text of the two. Their voices seemed really agitated as they discussed things, when my benefactor called me over to the table. \"Young one, come here please, hurry we might die of old age at any minute!\" he chuckled at his own joke and the others paused for a moment and started laughing with him. \"Please read this, and tell me what you think about it.\" He pointed at the paperback. \"Sure, let me take a look.\" I looked over at Bob who was shaking his head slightly in fear. \"I need to hold it, my eyes are bad.\" I picked up the paperback and took a quick look at the old book. It was written in a language, heck an ALPHABET that I didn't recognize. I read a passage they had pointed at on the page. It talked about the Eldritch ones and their using humans as pawns in their dominion over the Earth. I paused a moment and looked at the covers of the book. It looked like a cheap paperback that I would have found at the used bookstore in the county seat. \"I've not read this guy's stuff before. I think I'll find this for my Kindle.\" \"How did that make you feel reading it? \" They all leaned in toward me to hear my answer. \"Feel? I don't know. I ... I mean, I used to play Dungeons and Dragons back in High School and our DM, I mean Dungeon Master, tended to use just the Greek pantheon for our options for Clerics. It made it easier for us to grasp all of it.\" I shrugged. \"I think I get what they were talking about, but I am not really into this type of fantasy.\" \"Fantasy, you say, as in, not real?\" The benefactor seemed to chew on my use of the word pretty hard. \"Why do you call it fantasy?\" \"I mean, that's not real right? In the age of science, we 'd KNOW if there were ancient gods walking the Earth.\" I noticed Bob ran to the bathroom as I said that.

I shook my head in disappointment. \"Why did you do that?\" I screamed, shaking him violently, although he was unaffected by my physical efforts. \"I was just protecting you from motion sickness,\" he explained. \"Now, the rain is pH 6.99999999983, too acidic for me to let it hit your skin,\" he added, handing me an umbrella as I noticed the heavy clouds gathering in the sky. I threw the umbrella to the ground, but he placed it back in my hand at incomprehensible speeds. Getting annoyed about this was pointless; it wouldn't stop him. Nothing I could do now was going to change things, so I picked up a hot dog from an abandoned stall and began walking home grumpily. I bit into the salad, then tried to spit it out, but the rest of it was forcibly stuffed down my throat. \"Hot dogs are bad for you, so I gave you a salad instead,\" Azazel explained, munching on my hot dog as he said so."}, "t1_g8mgt9j": {"original_text": "\u201cAgent, you seem to be under the misconception that this panel has been convened to examine your job performance.

Now unfortunately for us, Ella gets bored easily and likes to \"liven things up a bit\" as she puts it. \"Yeah, I want to go over and put it on my head, but I want to do it without anyone seeing.\" \"Alright roll your stealth, oh and remember you have your cloak of shadows that gives you plus 5 to stealth\" You could see the glee in his eyes as he remembered that last bit. She made a big show of rolling the dice waving her hands around and blowing on them, Brent decided to close his eyes and put his hands over his ears while the rest of us watched transfixed. \"Holy crap it's a natural 20, that's like 33 right?\" \"Well it's a 32, but yeah that doesn't really change anything. So, you all start looking around the room for loot or anything you missed before.\" Everyone except for Ella Daniel and Brent have a look of utter disappointment on their faces. Ella and Daniel have the biggest shit eating grins while Brent's eyes were still closed and his hands were still firmly over his ears. I tapped him on the shoulder but he just shook his head. \"I don't want to know, I can't take it right now man.\" \"Right well, anyway. A few moments later Kralzug you notice that there is a floating bone crown that looks strangely similar to the one the Arch Emperor Lich King was wearing, you then see the small figure of your friend and companion under it.\" \"I grin and wave at Kralzug before putting it on.\" I have seen Daniel this happy 3 times before, twice right before he party wiped us and once when he got to the front page of Reddit. There was a small chance he just got to the front page again, though probably not a big one. \"You place the crown on your head, and feel nothing... Then you see the shadows spewing from the corpse of the Lich King coalescing into the form of a giant Tripbip, it doesn't look happy.\" \"Welp now that we're all going to be killed by a giant halfling shadow thing, I would like to cast Earthquake making sure that we're not in the area of effect.\". Well I guess I was right about the chances of Daniel making a front page post. Maybe I could play a Half-Orc bard for my next character, cause we're all about to wipe. Either the giant shadow Tripbip kills us or the fact that Sam is casting a earthquake spell underground in a ancient tomb will. Well I guess I should probably do something. \"Okay I want to run as fast as I can towards the dead body and see if I can find any magical looking object that would fit in that alter we found before.\" \"Alright, you find a fist sized rock with runes carved into it that looks like it might fit. While you do that the spell finishes casting and the room starts to tremble as cracks spread across the room.\" \"Oh crap I forgot we were underground.\" Brent finally comes back to us and I think he understands what I'm doing. Shit I'm just going to have to wing it. \"I want to sprint back to the room with the alter and shout for everyone to follow.\" \"I'm guessing everyone follows? If you don't say so. Alright so the door to that hasn't caved in yet so you can make it back there easily, though the Shadow Tripbip follows you.\" \"I shout to everyone else. 'Kralzug will kill Shadow Tripbip and save friends! For my friends!' I want to fight it while walking back a bit every turn\" Alright so Brent isn't the best with words but at least he knows my plan, I think. If he doesn't then well Kralzug thanks for your sacrifice. \"Okay Kralzug while you fight Shadow Tripbip you can see the throne room starting to collapse, the cracks racing towards you. The rest of you make it back to the alter.\" \"As soon as I get there I slam the stone into it.\" \"Instantly a purplish portal materializes before you, you can hear the tomb starting to collapse.\" Hah! It worked, I knew it would. Everyone saved again, the only problem is where the portal goes. \"Okay I tell the others to get in and shout as loud as possible to Kralzug to come, then as soon as they go through I do.\" \"Do either of you not want to go through the portal?\" \"I wait for Delaranthian to go through, then I do.\" \"Yeah I go through, how bad is the tomb doing by the way?\" \"Oh you know in a matter of minutes the entire tomb and connecting cave systems will be nothing but ruble.\" I'm not sure which of the two look more pleased by that. \"Did I hear that.\" \"Oh yeah sorry you did.\" \"I jump in the portal by the way, as soon as the other two do.\" \"Yeah I know.\" \"Right, I stop fighting and charge through the portal to freedom.\" HAH IT WORKED! No TPK tonight Daniel! \"You know you're going to take an attack of opportunity right?\" \"Yeah that's fine.\" \"Goddammit, Tripbip swings a shadowy claw at you but you puff out your chest and it bounces harmlessly off, you manage to slip away and jump into the portal just as it starts to fade. Well I think that's a good place to e...\" Daniel trails off as a incredibly loud banging and crashing sound comes from the kitchen. We all stop motionless staring each other. \"You locked the doors right Jake?\" Everyone was staring at me now, waiting for my answer. I had locked the door, hadn't I? My family wasn't home, and I defiantly locked the door. Was it the cat, or an earthquake that would be ironic. \"Uh yeah I think so, it's probably just the wind, if your so concerned go have a look for yourself.\" \"Um yeah I will, though someone should come with me, ya know in case.\" \"I'm thirsty anyway I'll come.\" About a minute later a loud 'holy shit!' from Brent followed by a gruff 'Who are you Human!? And what is this place?' then Daniel came sprinting back into the room with a look on his face I've never seen before. \"What the hell is happening in there Daniel?\" \"Uhh um, th- there is a massive Orc in your kitchen Jake.\" Edit: This is my first post here so any advice would be welcome :)", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\n\"Alright, so Tripbip, you want to take the black bone crown from the Arch Emperor Lich King's corpse, right?\" Daniel asked, his tone dripping with the kind of enthusiasm that usually precedes a catastrophic event.\n\nElla, ever the thrill-seeker, chimed in, \"Yeah, I want to go over and put it on my head, but I want to do it without anyone seeing.\" Daniel's eyes lit up as he reminded her, \"Alright, roll your Stealth, and don't forget you have your Cloak of Shadows, which gives you a +5 bonus.\"\n\nThe room fell silent as Ella made a show of rolling the dice, waving her hands around, and blowing on them for good luck. Brent, sensing impending doom, closed his eyes and covered his ears. The rest of us watched in rapt attention.\n\nWhen the dust settled, Ella exclaimed, \"Holy crap, it's a natural 20! That's like a 32!\" Daniel beamed with excitement, and Brent slowly opened his eyes, still looking apprehensive.\n\nAs we began to search the room for loot, Ella's grin grew wider, and Daniel's eyes sparkled with mischief. Brent, on the other hand, looked like he was bracing for impact.\n\nA few moments later, Kralzug noticed a floating bone crown that looked eerily similar to the one the Arch Emperor Lich King had worn. Ella, never one to resist temptation, grinned and waved at Kralzug before putting it on.\n\nDaniel's face lit up like a Christmas tree, and I couldn't help but think that we were all about to meet our maker. \"You place the crown on your head, and feel nothing... Then you see the shadows spewing from the corpse of the Lich King coalescing into the form of a giant Tripbip. It doesn't look happy,\" Daniel announced, his voice dripping with sadistic glee.\n\nSam, ever the pragmatist, suggested casting Earthquake, making sure we were out of the area of effect. I couldn't help but think that we were all doomed, either by the giant shadow Tripbip or the earthquake spell itself.\n\nAs the room began to tremble and cracks spread across the walls, I decided to make a break for the dead body, searching for any magical objects that might fit into the altar we had found earlier. Brent finally came back to reality, and I think he understood my plan.\n\nAs I sprinted back to the room with the altar, shouting for everyone to follow, the Shadow Tripbip gave chase. I slammed the stone into the altar, and a purplish portal materialized before us. The tomb began to collapse, and we knew we had to act fast.\n\nAs we made our way through the portal, Daniel announced that the entire tomb and connecting cave systems would be reduced to rubble in a matter of minutes. I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief as we escaped, but my joy was short-lived.\n\nAs we emerged from the portal, Daniel dropped a bombshell: \"You know you're going to take an attack of opportunity, right?\" Kralzug charged through the portal, dodging the Shadow Tripbip's attack by a hair's breadth.\n\nJust as we thought we had made it out alive, a loud banging and crashing sound came from the kitchen. We froze, staring at each other in confusion. \"You locked the doors, right, Jake?\" Daniel asked, his voice laced with concern.\n\nI hesitated, unsure if I had indeed locked the door. Brent volunteered to investigate, and what he found was beyond anything we could have imagined. \"Holy shit!\" he exclaimed, followed by a gruff \"Who are you, human? And what is this place?\"\n\nDaniel sprinted back into the room, his face ashen. \"What the hell is happening in there, Daniel?\" I asked, my heart racing.\n\n\"Uhh... there is a massive Orc in your kitchen, Jake,\" he stammered, his eyes wide with shock.\n}"}, "t1_ch5p1rq": {"original_text": "Michael Allen was dreading his birthday. He had entirely figured out the system, how to game life. Birthdays were his weakness. All his customary stoicism was threatened on that day, March 17th. Close to ending his two-hundredth year, there would certainly be a party. Most of his children were now dead, but his other descendants held a contempt for him that so motivated a party. They all knew he would hate it. Inspiring that feeling of hatred was their attempt to push Michael off the ledge, spiraling into the darkness of death which they had watched so many others greet with greater optimism. His first son, Freddy, died when he was seventeen. He had stupidly and unconditionally loved a girl, dying with a smile on his face. His second, Roger, lived to be much older, dying in his mid fifties. As he aged, each year of self hatred and bitterness slowly shaved his life away until he died from it. Michael had daughters too, but forced himself to care little for them, he wasn\u2019t entirely aware of their current status in life, or if they were living at all. Michael\u2019s marriage was fortunately one of convenience. He allowed himself to note only that she was tolerable, and nothing else.

For twelve hours, he had done nothing but read every piece of information he could find on the rules that came with his calling. The basics were simple and well-publicized: wings, bow, arrows, and the power to strike people with instantaneous (but real and permanent) love. But there was maddeningly few specifics on the Management side of the process. How does selection happen? Why are local snipers employed to be given assignments rather than upper-level staff in Management? Why can each sniper only strike one individual per assignment - to keep, as the manual says, \"the balance\"? He stared down at the red spiral notebook and flipped to the first page. Items to Clarify Before Moving Forward. He was not generally one to take risks, but time was running out. An assignment could come at any time and he wanted to be ready to move forward. Fabric brushed against the back of his neck; someone was behind him. He tried to swing around and knocked his notebook and pen from the table. His wife stepped in front of him, her hands raised high and a grin spreading across her face. He smiled sheepishly and turned to stand, but before he could Marcia pushed his shoulders down firmly and began kneading the tight knots of muscle that clustered together in his upper back. He groaned loudly. \"You are never allowed to stop.\" \"Mo-om!\" Their youngest daughter called from down the hall. Marcia leaned down closer to his desk and dropped an unmarked letter on his keyboard as she leaned in to kiss the bald spot on the top of his head. His stomach cramped as he glanced at the familiar envelope. \"You feeling ready?\" she asked, staring down at him from above. \"I think I'm as ready as I can be... but there are no guarantees. I've never broken protocol before...but then again, who knows if there is any reason for their rules. I can't see what could go wrong though.\" \"What you're doing is right,\" Marcia said confidently. \"I think you should go for it.\" As she turned to leave, Lester spun around in his chair and pulled her gently onto his lap. She laughed as he buried his head in her thick, auburn hair, which fell in waves down her back that smelled of cocoa butter and... \"Pasta sauce?\" She laughed wearily as he ran his fingers through a crusted strand of hair. \"Tomato basil soup,\" she answered. \"Lily hates it.\" As she began to get up, his arms tightened around her waist, tugging her in the opposite direction. Her laugh lilted musically as she wriggled to extricate herself, before finally slipping out and racing to the doorway. \"Take it easy, my love...\"she said. \"Save your energy for the people who need it - those who don't have what we do.\" Their eyes met and her face lit up. A second later she was gone, off to listen to their youngest declare with grave sincerity that a hairbrush is an implement of torture. He turned his attention to the envelope which held his 1545th assignment since he took the oath. Ten years ago he would have been thrilled to receive an assignment, to do his duty. Now he read it grimly and prepared. So much had changed. But he didn't have to. Lester's right arm ached as he pulled back on his bow for the 15th time, swiveling his head to check that no one could see him. The two sixteen-year old kids listed in the letter weren't hard to find. On the contrary, they were putting on quite the show from the back of a 1992 Ford Escort. They had parked at an empty community park and Lester had been lying on top of a nearby facilities building for over an hour, waiting for the flailing of limbs to stop long enough to get a good look. The back left window was down, but it still wasn't an easy shot. He kept getting so close that he was pulling back on his bow when they would roll into some new position and he would have to reset. Eventually he gave up, not willing to risk a shot until one of them left the car. Why them? As usual, the question began bouncing around his head, a constant companion during stakeouts. Last month he finally approached the management liaison, nervously sputtering out his concerns to a well-coiffed representative. The rep stared blankly as he introduced himself and explained his concerns. Erratic choices for selection. No clear reasons. Other alternatives that have demonstrated more hardship. Management seems to have lost sight of the greater good in this particular task. The rep's expression remained unchanged and the only indication he made that he had heard Lester was to nod so slightly it was almost imperceptible. He removed a tablet from his satchel and tapped/swiped/tapped until a robotic voice began speaking. \"Your duties do not include selection. If you are unable to complete your duties as assigned, report back for removal from this post.\" A few heavy thuds echoed across the soccer field that lay between Lester and his targets. Fog had clouded every one of the clunker's windows and Lester sat back, keeping his bow in position while staring at the car door for any sign of movement. After a few moments of stillness, he glanced down at the list he had brought with him. His selection list. These kids don't deserve a sniper, he thought as he scanned the first page. They're consumed with lust at this age anyway, there's no room for love. He closed the notebook triumphantly; for the 100th night in a row he had concluded that every name on his list would have been a better use of resources than the night's assignment. And tonight he was finally ready to do something about it. Sam Hirschman turned and waved before entering the park bathroom, worried that if he left for too long Jennifer, who was the hottest girl he had ever gotten into the Escort, would disappear, returning to the recesses of his imagination. He hastily dug out a joint from his pocket and lit it before taking position at the urinal. He sprayed the wall with a stream of urine that traced three and a half lop-sided circles before it instantaneously ceased. Sam doubled over, coughing and gasping for air as he collapsed onto the wet floor. He'd tell Jennifer later that it felt like a semi truck driving 90 miles an hour slammed striaght into his upper back and exploded. In the 20 minutes it took Jennifer to check on and find Sam, the arrow wound had healed completely, leaving only one sign of Lester that would be there forever: a 2 inch by 2 in ch patch of charcoal scar tissue that formed a perfect arrowhead. It took Lester less than an hour to hit his next target - the very first name on his list. Every detail came together according to plan, and exactly 47 minutes after he left Sam he sprinted to Mrs. Andrews' window. He watched her from the fire escape, quelling the urge to run back in and help the struggling 67-year-old woman who he had left prostrate in her kitchen. He stayed there for twenty minutes, teeth gritted as he watched her struggle for air. When she finally pulled herself up to sit, Lester let out a joyful yell that sent him flying up the fire escape. It was the only time he had ever been close to blowing his cover, but it was for good reason. His selection had gone off without a hitch. His choice had been careful, his research meticulous, his execution exact. Mrs. Andrews had never recovered from the death of her husband. And in ten years she had spent more nights than not alone with the sorrow that had become her companion. When a new tenant moved in, an older gentleman who had lost his wife to cancer a year back, Mrs. Andrews didn't think much of his invitations to tea or offer to help her carry groceries. But Lester set his sights on a future she couldn't yet see. He was still high on the success of his first solo operation when he burst through the door to his apartment. He woke up all three of his daughters, kissed each on the forehead and loudly proclaimed his love for them, shouting down sleepy protests. He poured a glass of wine for he and Marcia and carried it into their room with a slice of her favorite cheesecake - penance for coming home late and waking her up. He knew she wouldn't mind though - she would be eager to hear that he had taken next steps to do what Management was not up to. Lester tapped the door lightly with his knuckles as he nudged it open, trying to avoid startling her awake. As the door swung open, he turned to see Marcia, wide awake and fully dressed, standing next to their closet. \"Love? Is everything alright?\" She had something in her hand. She shoved it towards him like it was burning her and before he could reach out in time it spilled to the ground, clinking loudly against their bed frame. He keeled to pick up whatever she had discarded and froze when he saw, just below their dust cover, what looked like her wedding band. \"I \u2026 I can't do this anymore\u2026 I\u2019m leaving. And I want a divorce.\" Lester crumpled to the floor, dazed as his wife wheeled her suitcase of packed clothing in front of him and left their apartment. Before he could gather the composure to stop her, he heard her shoes cross their kitchen tile. Six clicks was all it took her to cross to the front door and not enough time for him to prepare for hearing it slam shut, leaving him alone. He lay motionless on their bedroom floor, waiting for her to come back, to explain. How long had she felt this way? Why wouldn't she have told him? His mind was racing - when was the last time we even fought? She hasn't seemed distant - have I been distant to her? His throat tightened. Is it someone else? He searched their bedroom for clues, for anything she had left behind. He found a beige lipstick. A business card for a Harry Leonardson. An old web cam she had used during the two years they were long-distance before getting married. A tear spilled onto the giant, old web cam and Lester wound up and threw it with all of his force at the window. The glass shattered with a soothingly appropriate level of noise.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text with improved syntax, grammar, and other necessary revisions:\n\n\\boxed{\nLester peered bleakly at his computer screen through bloodshot eyes.

He removed a tablet from his satchel and tapped/swiped/tapped until a robotic voice began speaking. \"Your duties do not include selection. If you are unable to complete your duties as assigned, report back for removal from this post.\"\n\nA few heavy thuds echoed across the soccer field that lay between Lester and his targets. Fog had clouded every one of the clunker's windows, and Lester sat back, keeping his bow in position while staring at the car door for any sign of movement. After a few moments of stillness, he glanced down at the list he had brought with him. His selection list. These kids don't deserve a sniper, he thought as he scanned the first page. They're consumed with lust at this age anyway; there's no room for love. He closed the notebook triumphantly; for the 100th night in a row, he had concluded that every name on his list would have been a better use of resources than the night's assignment. And tonight, he was finally ready to do something about it.\n\nSam Hirschman turned and waved before entering the park bathroom, worried that if he left for too long, Jennifer, who was the hottest girl he had ever gotten into the Escort, would disappear, returning to the recesses of his imagination. He hastily dug out a joint from his pocket and lit it before taking position at the urinal. He sprayed the wall with a stream of urine that traced three and a half lop-sided circles before it instantaneously ceased. Sam doubled over, coughing and gasping for air as he collapsed onto the wet floor. He'd tell Jennifer later that it felt like a semi-truck driving 90 miles an hour slammed straight into his upper back and exploded.\n\nIn the 20 minutes it took Jennifer to check on and find Sam, the arrow wound had healed completely, leaving only one sign of Lester that would be there forever: a 2-inch by 2-inch patch of charcoal scar tissue that formed a perfect arrowhead.\n\nIt took Lester less than an hour to hit his next target - the very first name on his list. Every detail came together according to plan, and exactly 47 minutes after he left Sam, he sprinted to Mrs. Andrews' window. He watched her from the fire escape, quelling the urge to run back in and help the struggling 67-year-old woman who he had left prostrate in her kitchen. He stayed there for twenty minutes, teeth gritted as he watched her struggle for air. When she finally pulled herself up to sit, Lester let out a joyful yell that sent him flying up the fire escape. It was the only time he had ever been close to blowing his cover, but it was for good reason. His selection had gone off without a hitch. His choice had been careful, his research meticulous, his execution exact.\n\nMrs. Andrews had never recovered from the death of her husband. And in ten years, she had spent more nights than not alone with the sorrow that had become her companion. When a new tenant moved in, an older gentleman who had lost his wife to cancer a year back, Mrs. Andrews didn't think much of his invitations to tea or offer to help her carry groceries. But Lester set his sights on a future she couldn't yet see.\n\nHe was still high on the success of his first solo operation when he burst through the door to his apartment. He woke up all three of his daughters, kissed each on the forehead, and loudly proclaimed his love for them, shouting down sleepy protests. He poured a glass of wine for him and Marcia and carried it into their room with a slice of her favorite cheesecake - penance for coming home late and waking her up. He knew she wouldn't mind, though - she would be eager to hear that he had taken next steps to do what Management was not up to.\n\nLester tapped the door lightly with his knuckles as he nudged it open, trying to avoid startling her awake. As the door swung open, he turned to see Marcia, wide awake and fully dressed, standing next to their closet. \"Love, is everything alright?\" She had something in her hand. She shoved it towards him like it was burning her, and before he could reach out in time, it spilled to the ground, clinking loudly against their bed frame. He keeled to pick up whatever she had discarded and froze when he saw, just below their dust cover, what looked like her wedding band.\n\n\"I... I can't do this anymore... I'm leaving. And I want a divorce.\" Lester crumpled to the floor, dazed as his wife wheeled her suitcase of packed clothing in front of him and left their apartment. Before he could gather the composure to stop her, he heard her shoes cross their kitchen tile. Six clicks was all it took her to cross to the front door, and not enough time for him to prepare for hearing it slam shut, leaving him alone.\n\nHe lay motionless on their bedroom floor, waiting for her to come back, to explain. How long had she felt this way? Why wouldn't she have told him? His mind was racing - when was the last time we even fought? She hasn't seemed distant - have I been distant to her? His throat tightened. Is it someone else? He searched their bedroom for clues, for anything she had left behind. He found a beige lipstick. A business card for a Harry Leonardson. An old web cam she had used during the two years they were long-distance before getting married.\n\nA tear spilled onto the giant, old web cam, and Lester wound up and threw it with all of his force at the window. The glass shattered with a soothingly appropriate level of noise.\n}"}, "t1_cnwu52t": {"original_text": "I awoke. I was in a palace of some sort, with beautiful marble columns.

It is a heavy thing, a weight beyond measure. I am the oldest man alive. I was born in time to see the last of the Roman Empire crumble into ruin. By all means, I should have died when the chariots of those foreign savages rolled through my town, crushing the dried autumn leaves beneath their hard, wooden wheels. But I did not die then. Iron forged for bloodshed, diseases that eat the skin off of your bones, the failing of the body under the relentless rolling of Time; none of these touched me. I have lived nearly fifteen hundred years, impervious to all harm. Yet, despite all this, I have carried the heaviest burden for one and a half millennia; the fear of Death. Why should the undying fear death? I have dreams, yes. I've had thousands. Tens of thousands - all forgotten. But once in a very long time, when I lay down on the ground, or in a lice-infested bunk, or whatever resting place life has provided for me, when I close my eyes, I am struck with a powerful vision. This vision I can never forget. Through clouds of thick, ashen smoke, I hear a growl. It is distant, even ignorable, at first, until the clouds part. The black, hard carapace shifts behind the smog, and the growling becomes a roar - a roar that splits my head apart, that bears down on me from all angles, until I am smothered by the smoke and I do not know where to run. And then the smokey, ashen clouds part, and I see the Beast. And I know that it is Death.

I had seen the Empire that built them collapse like a man struck down by some unseen assailant in a pitch-black alley.

I looked to the windows, and saw no faces - only empty, glassy panes, and thin, metallic chimneys sticking up like the legs of a beetle on it's back. Smoke poured up from those chimneys, until the sun was a greasy mirage, struggling to touch the ground. She grew a stubborn girl, which might have been my fault, and remained obstinate in her aging years. No amount of encouraging or coaxing could move her faster. Yet as we wandered under the eaves of the buildings, I knew the feeling would not shake. I knew I was stuck with it.

God damn, my alarm clock was never this loud. My eyes crawl open, my vision hazy. They struggle to adjust to the light as I sit up in my cot. My cot? Something isn't right. My vision comes into focus and I find myself staring down at a grimy concrete floor, full of cracks and streaked with dirt. I look to my side and see a filthy, thin mattress atop a metal frame. A stench of body odor, urine, and god knows what else wafts into my nose and I nearly gag. This isn't right at all. Where the hell am I? Still recoiling from the odor, I look up into the face of a large tattooed man in an orange jumpsuit sitting on a cot across from mine. He's staring me dead in the eyes and clutching a boot in one hand. On his face he wears a look of sheer terror. \"Hey, what is this place?\" I attempt to ask him, but my voice is so hoarse I'm only able to grunt before bursting into a fit of coughing. The man starts at the sounds and inches farther onto his cot, the clutch on his boot tightening. I manage to clear my throat and ask, \"What is this place? Where am I?\" \"You stay the hell away from me, alright?\" he stammers in a Southern drawl, sliding even farther away from me until his back is up against the wall. \"Hey, what's the matter? What are you so afraid of?\" I'm growing ever more nervous by the second. If this thug is so afraid of this place...afraid of me?...what the hell is going on?! \"Listen, I know what you've done, what you're capable of, and you're not taking me down, too. Just STAY AWAY FROM ME!\" his voice cracks as the fear on his face grows ever more intense. I notice deep bags under his eyes and realize he's probably spent the whole night cowering on that cot, brandishing a boot. \"Buddy, I wish I knew what you were talking about,\" I reply, \"but honestly, I have no idea what's going on.\" \"Oh, is that right?\" he spits back at me. \"No idea? Just like all those people last week had no idea? I mean, god damn, I've done some awful things in my life, and I'm doing my time, but you...you're a monster! You're a god damn monster!\" He's nearly screaming at this point, his face growing red with the exertion. \"There were kids there, man! Fuckin' kids!\" \"Hey!\" I shout at him. His eyes grow wider and he curls into a ball, tears starting to stream down his face. \"Calm down, man, Jesus! There's been some mistake, I have no clue what you're talking about! Last thing I remember, I was at a bar downtown with two of my friends. I might have had a few too many drinks, but I was about to call a cab home when I blacked out. That's all I know, I swear to God. So please, just work with me here...where the fuck am I?\" \"Take a wild guess, Sherlock,\" he says, gesturing to his left. I look where he's pointing, and for the first time notice the bars blocking the entrance to what I've finally realized is a cell. \"I'm in jail?! Shit, what the hell happened? Is this the drunk tank, or what? Did I really have that much to drink?\" My mind is racing, trying to comprehend how I could have possibly wound up here. This can't be the drunk tank. It's just the two of us in here. This is bad, this is really, really bad. My companion's gaze softens ever so slightly. \"I can't tell if you're serious or if you're really so deranged that you just can't help lyin' to people. Honestly it wouldn't surprise me, you fucking freak.\" \"Come on! Why would I make this up? I seriously don't know how I got here.\" \"Well, you'll find out soon enough, shit-head!\" a gruff voice bellows from the hallway. \"Come on, it's breakfast! Get your asses up!\" I look towards the bars and see a bald man dressed like a police officer unlocking the cell door and holding 2 pairs of handcuffs. \"Officer! Thank god you're here, there's been a mistake! I don't know-\" \"Shut up!\" he interrupts with a shout. \"I'm no officer, son. I'm a guard, and as a guard, I have a different code of ethics. First thing you need to know about Hopkins is that you speak when you're spoken to here. You people are scum, and here, we treat you as such! Now stand up and come with me!\" He swings the door open and immediately slaps handcuffs on both our wrists. \"I'm not going with him,\" my cellmate says in a hushed tone. \"Too bad, Hornsby! It's 6:30 AM, which means it's breakfast, which means every second you waste sittin' on your lily ass, my coffee gets colder, and if I don't get my coffee, you don't get rec time! Do I make myself clear?!\" Hornsby glances up at the guard, then back at me, then at the guard again. Finally, he sets down his boot, unclenches his hands, and stands up, staying as far away from me as possible. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Good! Now get movin, pretty boy!\" He attaches a chain to both our cuffs and pulls hard, leading us into the corridor and toward the mess hall. He leads us past other cells, empty of inmates, and joins a slow-moving group of men all clad in orange and led by other guards. I glance down at my chest and realize I'm wearing the same orange jumpsuit as the rest. On my left breast pocket is a patch bearing the ID: \"HSP-MS-I98045.\" So, I'm in prison. Shit, last night went much worse than I thought. The guard attaches our chain to the chains of the mass ahead of us and steps to the side, keeping pace. I nudge an inmate ahead of me and whisper, \"Psst! Hey, man, what is this place?\" The man turns around with anger in his eyes, and quietly says, \"Shut the fuck up! You tryin' to land in solitary?\" He turns forward and I nudge him again. \"Quit it, man! This is fuckin' Hopkins, they don't play nice here!\" He looks in my eyes and suddenly, the anger turns to fear. He faces forward and quickens his pace, bumping into other inmates, trying to get through the crowd. What the hell? This guy, too? \"Hey, watch it!\" someone ahead shouts as the man keeps pushing, throwing himself at the others, trying in vain to get as far away from me as possible. The other inmates are starting to get angry, and the guards, noticing the commotion, pull weapons from their belts and move forward to stop the mayhem from spreading. \"Everybody, stop where you are! You have 3 seconds before everyone here gets sent back to their cells!\" The writhing crowd freezes, save for the man still trying to get away. One of the inmates, an enormous bald man covered in swastika tattoos, pushes him over, and looks my way in fury, trying to determine what caused his panic. Once he sees my face, the same look of terror spreads across his, and he, too starts pulling at his chains and pushing people out of the way. \"EVERYBODY FUCKING FREEZE!\" The guards have their weapons drawn now, firing tasers into the crowd, beating people in the sides with billy clubs. Their efforts are in vain, more and more people are noticing me, and every face that turns my way looks terrified. The thrashing mob is pulling me forward by the wrists and tugging me every which way, until finally... The chain snaps. Um...okay. I turn around and make a run for it. Now's my chance to get away, the guards are distracted and no one is paying attention to me. I'm going to find someone in charge and finally get this whole mess figured ou- My wrists are yanked backwards, as my whole body contorts and I fall to the ground, hard. Shit, I forgot about Hornsby. He's stayed frozen in place, his terrified gaze now looking as if it's permanently marred his features. \"Hands up, maggot!\" The guard who opened our cell is heading towards me, taser drawn. His coffee is most certainly cold. \"No, wait, please!\" I beg, \"this is all a mistake! I don't know why I'm here, you have to-\" My body convulses as 50,000 volts of electricity are pumped through me. As my vision fades to black, the last thing I hear is a frantic cry of, \"Please, I'll go to solitary, I'll clean latrines for a month, just get me away from him!\" ... I'm standing in a narrow alleyway, rain pouring down around me. There's a single light overhead, flickering and buzzing. A dark figure stands at the other end, pointing a gun square at my chest. \"This is it, Jack,\" he says. \"Give me the detonator and we can forget any of this ever happened.\" I don't know what to say...but apparently that isn't a problem. \"Fuck off, Donny,\" I find myself saying, my words slurred. \"This was bound to happen and you know it.\" \"Jack,\" he's pleading, \"this isn't like you! I've known you for years, you've always been the kindest person I've ever known! Think of your family, Jack!\" He sounds on the verge of tears. \"Think of Sally, think of your kids! What are they going to think about you if you go through with this? Please, Jack...just give me the detonator. We can make this right, but you have to work with me. Just hand it over. Please...\" He extends his other hand, slowly. \"It's too late for that, Donny!\" I say, realizing my arm is bent at the elbow. I'm holding a tiny black box in my hand, with a single switch that says simply: \"ARM.\" \"You knew it was too late when you decided to spread lies about me!\" \"What are you talking about?! Come on, you're my best friend! I would never-\" \"You slandered my name!\" I scream, \"You called me a thief and a coward! You made a fool of me in front of the whole board of directors! Well, now I'm going to make it right.\" \"Jack, don't do this!\" \"The ends justify the means, Donny, you slimy fucker. This is where it ends.\" \"Jack, no!\" I flip the switch. The ground shakes below me as an earth-shattering blast nearly ruptures my eardrums. I lose my footing and start to fall, but then a second blast sounds off, much closer. There is a sharp pain in my forehead, and I hear myself scream as the world goes black.", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nPART 1\n\nI awaken to the sound of a buzzer blaring above my head. God damn, my alarm clock was never this loud. My eyes crawl open, my vision hazy. They struggle to adjust to the light as I sit up in my cot. My cot? Something isn't right. My vision comes into focus, and I find myself staring down at a grimy concrete floor, full of cracks and streaked with dirt. I look to my side and see a filthy, thin mattress atop a metal frame. A stench of body odor, urine, and God knows what else wafts into my nose, and I nearly gag. This isn't right at all. Where the hell am I?\n\nStill recoiling from the odor, I look up into the face of a large, tattooed man in an orange jumpsuit sitting on a cot across from mine. He's staring me dead in the eyes and clutching a boot in one hand. On his face, he wears a look of sheer terror.\n\n\"Hey, what is this place?\" I attempt to ask him, but my voice is so hoarse I'm only able to grunt before bursting into a fit of coughing. The man starts at the sounds and inches farther onto his cot, the clutch on his boot tightening.\n\nI manage to clear my throat and ask, \"What is this place? Where am I?\"\n\n\"You stay the hell away from me, alright?\" he stammers in a Southern drawl, sliding even farther away from me until his back is up against the wall.\n\n\"Hey, what's the matter? What are you so afraid of?\" I'm growing ever more nervous by the second. If this thug is so afraid of this place...afraid of me?...what the hell is going on?!\n\n\"Listen, I know what you've done, what you're capable of, and you're not taking me down, too. Just STAY AWAY FROM ME!\" his voice cracks as the fear on his face grows ever more intense. I notice deep bags under his eyes and realize he's probably spent the whole night cowering on that cot, brandishing a boot.\n\n\"Buddy, I wish I knew what you were talking about,\" I reply, \"but honestly, I have no idea what's going on.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that right?\" he spits back at me. \"No idea? Just like all those people last week had no idea? I mean, God damn, I've done some awful things in my life, and I'm doing my time, but you...you're a monster! You're a goddamn monster!\"\n\nHe's nearly screaming at this point, his face growing red with the exertion.\n\n\"There were kids there, man! Fuckin' kids!\" he exclaims.\n\n\"Hey!\" I shout at him. His eyes grow wider, and he curls into a ball, tears starting to stream down his face.\n\n\"Calm down, man, Jesus! There's been some mistake, I have no clue what you're talking about! Last thing I remember, I was at a bar downtown with two of my friends. I might have had a few too many drinks, but I was about to call a cab home when I blacked out. That's all I know, I swear to God. So please, just work with me here...where the fuck am I?\"\n\n\"Take a wild guess, Sherlock,\" he says, gesturing to his left. I look where he's pointing, and for the first time, I notice the bars blocking the entrance to what I've finally realized is a cell.\n\n\"I'm in jail?! Shit, what the hell happened? Is this the drunk tank, or what? Did I really have that much to drink?\" My mind is racing, trying to comprehend how I could have possibly wound up here. This can't be the drunk tank. It's just the two of us in here. This is bad, this is really, really bad.\n\nMy companion's gaze softens ever so slightly.\n\n\"I can't tell if you're serious or if you're really so deranged that you just can't help lying to people.

It was the trademark smell of the hospital, that kind of smell that makes people feel uneasy for reasons that aren't fully realized; perhaps a fear of the hospital and the sharp objects it holds, or maybe just the overall sense of not exactly being in control of a situation. When you're t-boned by an eighteen wheeler and have your ribcage crushed, there really isn't much control you can have. Joel eyed the mess of crusted blood and broken bones that was the body of the young Julie Crones, grimacing as he took notes of her skin coloration. It was January 1st; the cold weather that came with the day made the already cold morgue feel even more unnaturally cold than it normally was. Joel was still hungover from the New Years party his friends had through the night before, and judging from Julie's charts, she'd probably be hungover too if she had still been breathing at the moment. The large double doors to the morgue burst open, one door clanging into a wall and the other into an unused gurney. Joel turned to look at who the noisemaker was only to see a young woman with blonde hair rush forward. She was wearing what looked like a black tunic, black jeans, and plain white tennis shoes. The antiseptic smell that normally permeated the morgue vanished as she ran towards Joel and Julie. \"Hey you're not- The woman pushed Joel to the side with a firm hand to his sternum, wedging herself between him and the deceased Julie.

He stood there, wondering if he should find a doctor or if he should deal with this woman who had the touch of death, but the thoughts were soon thrown aside. The strange blonde woman was attempting to resuscitate the long dead and cold Julie. She had her hands pressed into Julie's sternum, causing Julie's ribcage to audibly crack with each press. \"Hey,\" Joel said lightly, \"she's already dead, she's been dead for awhile.\" The blonde woman ignored Joel and instead resorted to mouth to mouth. \"Whoa whoa whoa, that's not necessary, she's gone!\" Joel yelled, stepping forward and reaching out with a tentative hand. Before he touched the crazed woman, she turned to him, tears streaming down her face. \"No,\" she cried, \"I couldn't save her. I can't save anyone at all! Why can't I save anyone?\" Well, I can think of a few good reasons, one being that you were a couple hours too late, Joel thought.

There weren't many opportunities in life to become someone else, but this was one of them. My friends were already online, waiting for me. Georgie had rolled a Dragonkin knight and was already cleaving her way through the rambling forces of demon spawn with a battleaxe almost as big as she was. It was the perfect fit for the girl with the big personality and even bigger voice. By contrast, Ed, the quiet one of our group, had rolled an Elven monk, at peace with himself, he healed Georgie through her furious antics while defending himself with an intricately engraved staff. Danny, of course, had rolled a human rogue. He was already setting traps for the opposing faction and had angered an entire village by stealing chicken eggs. Why he wanted the eggs is anyone's guess. Now, finally I was home from work and ready to reveal my character. There was no going back after I hit the character creation button. The buffering icon rotated as it randomly generated my character for life. Georgie and Danny were joking over Discord about what I was going to get but I didn't rise to it, I was confident in this. I was going to be something that dealt a lot of damage, maybe a mage or a hunter, that would complete our dungeon group and be the perfect fit for me. At least, that's what I thought right up until the screen changed. It must be a bug, a glitch of some kind, I don't believe what I see on the screen. My friends are asking me what I got but I can't bring myself to answer. How do I explain this? The whole UI had changed, where the animated battlefields of Ameryth had been glowing in the background, there was nothing but darkness. In the centre, where there should be his randomly generated character dancing was a single message box. I look for a little X in the corner or a back button but I'm not offered one. All the box says is \"Welcome, Chosen One, to your world: Ameryth.\"Maybe they've just changed the welcome message, it did seem to be a bit early for a patch but perhaps I'd missed it while I was at work. I was about to ask my friends if there'd been a hotfix already when the message changed.\"Should a deity tell it's subjects that it is their god?\" I stare at the words, a deity? That wasn't on the list of races or classes. It must be a bug. The words faded and revealed new ones again. \"You are the Game Master, you are god.\" A Game Master? How could I be a Game Master? What did that even mean? The words shifted and changed, they were my only hope in this dark new world. \"While you may not walk the surface of Ameryth, you are it's guiding light. You are god.\" The message box vanished leaving the screen black. My heart hammered in my chest. If I couldn't play the game what was the point? Slowly a light bloomed across the screen, it revealed the world of Ameryth turning below me. Next the tool bars appeared along either side of my screen. I barely had chance to look at what the buttons did before a message icon flashed in the top right hand corner. I hovered my mouse over it. \"Prayer\" was all it said. I clicked on it to open the message box. \"Dear GM, god of Ameryth. I pray for your mercy, for I am trapped behind an NPC in the back of a barn and cannot get out. Please have mercy and free me.\" I could free the poor soul or I could leave him trapped there for all eternity. As I surveyed my array of omnipotent tools I realised that it was completely within my power to teleport them into an end game dungeon where the level 3 goblin shaman would die over and over again to the wrath of the level 100 demon lord. Alternatively, I could move him to the temple of Shiraan where he would be doted upon forever by the priestesses who lived there. My friends were losing patience as they waited for me to reply to them in the Discord channel. Does a god reveal to its subjects that it is a god? Yes. Yes it does. \"I am god\" I type. They laugh until they realise that I'm not joking. They don't believe me though until I force them all to dance, Georgie even tried logging out and back in again but when her character didn't stop dancing they realised the truth. I had never been the powerful one before but now I was their god. I was the god of the whole of Ameryth. The prayers were already pouring in as my subjects discovered unfortunate bugs and glitches in the new world. My mouse hovered over the tools at my disposal as I considered my options.

The look was forlorn, probably, but I couldn't really tell what my face would have told an observer. A face with 75 years of wear and tear built into the skin and eyes is somewhat opaque. The gaps between forlorn, melancholy, amused, and confused facial expressions on a younger person are rather clear. Recognizing those gaps is normally a matter of noticing when responsive, youthful skin twitches after a hidden tug from a tendon or muscle buried under layers of facial tissue. This grows to be impossible as gravity robs our skin of elasticity. Age. Cunt. My eyes drifted to my tie. I am the only septuagenarian graduating this semester. I am, as far as I know, the only septuagenarian who has graduated from any school in my state since... Since... Well, funny how age works. They told me earlier this week. Could have been the 1980s or the 1880s, for all I know. I don't remember. My hands will themselves to stroke my chin and run themselves through my hair, seek a pocket with some index cards. The date is on the third index card. I know this because I made sure to include that observation while writing my speech. I am not really giving a speech. But I wrote these cards out just in case. They don't allow septuagenarians to bumble onto stage to give speeches to little teeny boppers fresh on the job market for the first time.

I have been in hot wars and cold wars and economic busts and booms. Maybe someone will ask. My hand flicks a corner of an index card. Not one of the men I knew in 1961 would have been able to graduate college. None of them survived the war. I turned to the third card. 1992. I slip the cards, in order, back in my pocket. My sister is taking me to graduation because my children are gone now. The bell rings. That will be her. I open the door, and she pushes past me with a box. \"Bleach,\" she said. \"I... What?\" \"Bleach. I washed your graduation robe for you because it's a rental and who knows where they have been or whether they were washed at all when they were returned or what and I know you have sensitive skin so I just washed it.\" She took a deep breath. \"But I made a mistake. I didn't mean to.\" My face microscopically transitioned from forlorn to amused as she pulled a bleach-pink robe.

Even before I knew it was the train you take, I was horrified.\u201d &#x200B; \u201cAnd you were hurt so bad\u201d, a tear trickled down her cheek. \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you, but you\u2019re too hard-headed to die on me.\u201d &#x200B; Dr Bernstein spoke then, \u201cYou have recovered remarkably well, Mr Collins. Blunt force trauma to the left side of your head was the most serious injury, but you had burns on both legs and multiple scratches and bruises down your right side from broken glass. It looks like someone might have dragged you out of the wreckage, although we don\u2019t know that for sure. You were found by paramedics a little way from the carriage closest the rear of the train.\u201d &#x200B; I always sit there. Fourth carriage. Back seat on the left. Behind the guy with the square glasses and next to the old lady with the knitting. Others come and go, but those two always have the same seats, day after day. The WiFi is best there, so there are lots of youngsters in that carriage in the morning, and busy looking business types in the evening, but they get on the stop after me, so I normally get my spot on the 815 in the morning and the 1715 at night. It takes me from work to home in 40 minutes. &#x200B; See, I like routine because my memory is so bad. Habits get me through life. As my dad used to say \u201cDon\u2019t have to remember to do it if you do it habitually.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he ever forgot anything in his life, though. Leastways, he always remembered when he promised me we could go for ice cream. &#x200B; They were both looking at me from the end of the bed. I realised I hadn\u2019t replied, and I must be a bit disoriented because I thought my wife was by my side. &#x200B; \u201cThanks Doc\u201d, I managed to say. \u201cAre there likely to be any ongoing problems? I feel kinda weird. And my eye?\u201d &#x200B; She looked concerned at my admission, and looked at the clipboard she had picked up without me noticing. \u201cHead injuries are always risky,\u201d she replied. \u201cand because of the extensive damage, we\u2019re going to have to keep you here for some considerable time. Your eye had glass in it, which we able to remove completely, and the eye itself is healing nicely, but we\u2019ll have to wait a while before we know for sure whether you have any visual problems. Don\u2019t try to use it before it\u2019s completely healed.\u201d &#x200B; \u201cAs for the feeling weird. Can you explain what you mean?\u201d &#x200B; I struggled to put words to the feeling, but my attempts to articulate the constricted feeling I had experienced left even me unsatisfied. &#x200B; \u201cI\u2019d like you to keep a diary of how you\u2019re feeling, if you don\u2019t mind. Let me know the highlights, and if you have anything more concrete which concerns you, note it down in as many ways as you can so that we can address it.\u201d She smiled brightly, in the way that people do when they are unsure, but anxious to radiate calm. \u201cIn the meantime, drink lots of water, get lots of sleep, and don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d &#x200B; I nodded, realising that simply being awake had exhausted me, and I fell asleep a few minutes later, to the muffled sounds of a hospital at night. &#x200B; Day Two ====== I have been unconscious for the best part of a month, it turns out. My work have put me on the long-term sick list, and aren\u2019t expecting me back any time soon. &#x200B; I spent the morning reminiscing with my wife, reminding her of the time we visited Paris. How we had sat under a hill just outside the city, a tree at our back, looking down on houses below, and a baby goat from a nearby farm decided we were the most interesting thing in the world and was determined to get in our picnic basket. Her laughs as I described the antics in great detail warmed my heart, and her delight at long forgotten memories were a balm to my growing unease. &#x200B; You see, I remember the picnic incident as plain as if it had happened moments ago, even though I\u2019ve not thought about it in years. It\u2019s like a movie playing in my head that I can instantly jump to any part of. &#x200B; I\u2019ve always been able to remember anything I saw on a screen, which makes my job as a software developer a whole lot easier, but I\u2019ve always struggled to remember the more mundane parts of life. Did I lock the front door, did I check the windows before bed, did I make sure the oven is off? &#x200B; I mentioned remembering the picnic incident to Dr Bernstein, and she was pleased that I could remember things from long term memory. Apparently that was a concern for some of the surgeons. That worried me more, but she calmed my fears, and assured me that I was in good hands, and everything had gone well during the month I had been unconscious. &#x200B; The afternoon was spent watching reruns of old shows on the tiny hospital TV. I fell asleep a dozen times, and each time I woke, a different show was on. &#x200B; Day Three ======== I had a horrendous dream last night. It was strangely vivid, so I am writing it down before I forget it. &#x200B; I dreamt I had awoken in a strange bed to a screaming burning coming from the side of my head. Alarms were going off, and smoke filled the air. It felt so real, and still does. I\u2019m shaking as I write this. &#x200B; In my mind\u2019s eye, I can still see blood and bodies and death and destruction. I was blinded by the smoke, and I blinked watery eyes to work out what I was seeing. The rebel army was attacking, which made perfect sense to my dream self, but is obviously nonsense now. Blood dripped from my beard (I\u2019m clean shaven), and splashed onto a map of a place I\u2019ve never seen before. I looked at my arm, and a holographic image of several dozen soldiers who wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a science fiction movie took shape. &#x200B; I knew there was no way out, and a calm took me. I lifted a small plain glass plate with rounded edges from a pocket on my jacket, and stared at the very recognisable beardless man with a bandage round his head and covering one eye. &#x200B; \u201cYour turn, Jonas\u201d, said my dream self, and I woke up for the second time in as many minutes. &#x200B; I never remember dreams, except maybe that weird one about a cartoon beach ball changing into a shark, but this one stayed in my mind all day. &#x200B; .. &#x200B; I\u2019ve replayed the two minute dream in my head over and over, and it makes just as little sense now as it did when I wrote it down this morning. &#x200B; I had two working eyes in the dream, and I was Captain James Tollinson, third in command on the Ceti Expeditionary Force. I smiled at the thought. I am not adventurous, and I don\u2019t like telling people what to do. I\u2019m easy going, and prefer to let others get their way. &#x200B; Perhaps my subconscious was try to help with my last performance review at work. &#x200B; \u201cYou\u2019re work is great\u201d, my boss had written in his truly abysmal grammatical style, \u201cbut you need to be more forcefull. You have good ideas, but you always let other people do it there way.\u201d &#x200B; Grammar aside, he had a point. I hated being the one to decide anything, and I definitely prefer the quiet life, even if I have to work a little harder because of it. &#x200B; (to be continued)", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text with improved syntax, grammar, and revisions:\n\n\\boxed{\nDay One\n\nThe doctor has told me I should keep a diary to help me remember. Head injuries like mine can have complications, she's told me. It's a good idea to write things down because memories can be fleeting sometimes.\n\nI don't remember the accident itself. I awoke in this bed, with my wife asleep holding my hand, and a drip in my arm. \"Get Well Soon\" cards festooned a cabinet in my line of sight, but the bandages wound too tightly around my head covered my left eye and prevented me from seeing any more.\n\nA dull thumping headache threatened to make me sick when I thought about moving, and I fell asleep again, dreaming of ambulance sirens chasing me through a thousand rooms.\n\nIt was dark outside when I awoke again, to the sound of murmured voices. I recognized my wife's voice. It always made me smile, and I smiled then. My throat was dry, and I needed water. The headache was gone, but a tightness remained, like a belt straining against too much food. I coughed painfully, and swallowed uncomfortably, and the voices stopped.\n\n\"He's awake now,\" said a voice I later learned was Dr. Elizabeth Bernstein, a specialist in cranial reconstruction. \"Can you hear us, Jonas?\"\n\nI tried to ask for water, and my croaking must have been recognizable enough, because my wife, standing next to the doctor, smiled that smile which had made me fall in love with her and poured me some water from a jug beside the hospital bed.\n\nShe held my hand and looked into my eyes. With a quaver in her normally calm voice, she said, \"There was a big gas leak at the old power plant.

She always thought that maybe it was some sort of genetic fluke when she inherited some of my powers such as flight, super strength and the like. But I can't fault that the wife and I raised her right, I guess. She had no idea I was aware of her secret, however. And that was for the better. If she had arrived at a bank and recognized Wraith, the world's most powerful and undefeated supervillain as her own father... well, I feel that would possibly kill her like it did her mother. I guess I did prefer the quiet life of being an investor, though. I could sit around and read all day, work out even though it didn't really help and all... I learned carpentry as a hobby. Although, my retirement from the world of super-powered crime came to an end when that one report came on the news. 'Breaking news,' the anchorwoman said. 'Terrorists have seized the New York offices of Atlantic City News and have placed a nuclear weapon inside the building.' I looked up from my building in shock. That was where Julie worked in her civilian identity! 'What...?' I asked in shock. 'The National Guard tried to evacuate civilians away from the building before several trucks were destroyed by bombs,' the anchorwoman said. 'The terrorist leader, known only as Tecno, has declared that he will detonate if he believes that anyone is being evacuated. Other demands have not yet been made but-' I switched over to ACN's channel and saw reporters and other staff being hurried into the main studio. And that was when I saw Julie sitting in the room. She was tied to the bomb. 'We will make this clear,' one robotic minion said. 'Ten billion dollars deposited into the account shown on-screen or the bomb will detonate. You have twenty-four hours to comply.' The President won't allow anyone to pay, he was rather anal about the \"We don't negotiate with terrorists\" nonsense. Although his predecessor did comply when I lifted the White House and threatened to drop him and his family onto the ground. But I knew what buttons to press. What Tecno was doing... far too excessive to be worth it. And yet, I felt a great fire within my chest. I set my book down, pulled out my phone and made my way to the garage while calling a number.

'Fuck, that was Julie,' she groaned. 'Well, I guess it's true why you retired? She's Fantasia?' 'One word,' I said to her, 'and you will be screaming for weeks as I kill you.'

'What was it that cost you the use of your legs? Medea caught you trying to groom her kids? I'm surprised you're still alive after that. You're meant to tell your neighbors about something like that, right?' 'L-look, man,' he tried to plead. 'I ain't done nothing for you!' 'Oh, that is absolutely wrong,' I said calmly while returning to him, calmly throwing him - and his wheelchair - over to the nearby wall. 'My kid is working in New York. Sweet kid as well. Don't know how a bastard like myself created something so pure.' I picked up a nearby rope and then walked over to Adrian, throwing his head down between his knees so I could tie his hands together. Then I threw his head back up. I tied two ends to his ankles then hung him upside down from two wooden beams. 'W-what are you d-doing?!' he screamed. 'Ma! Ma, where are you?!' 'Just... just hold that thought for one moment,' I said as I pulled something out of the box, extended it, fixed a bolt and... 'What the shit?!' Tecno screamed. 'A-a chainsaw?!'

And guess how long it will take before this even begins to kill you?' 'T-twenty four hours?' he guessed. '...More like half an hour,' I said to him. Then I stood up, walking towards the stairs. 'Wait!' he screamed. 'My ma can't find me like this! It'll kill her. Please!' 'Oh, don't worry,' I said while giving him a wicked smile. Then he started struggling. 'Don't you hurt my ma!' he yelled.

She always thought it was some sort of genetic fluke when she inherited some of my powers, such as flight and super strength. But I couldn't fault the fact that my wife and I raised her right, I guess. She had no idea I was aware of her secret, and that was for the better. If she had arrived at a bank and recognized Wraith, the world's most powerful and undefeated supervillain, as her own father... well, I feel that would possibly kill her, just like it did her mother.\n\nI guess I did prefer the quiet life of being an investor, though. I could sit around and read all day, work out (even though it didn't really help), and I even learned carpentry as a hobby. Although, my retirement from the world of super-powered crime came to an end when that one report came on the news. \"Breaking news,\" the anchorwoman said. \"Terrorists have seized the New York offices of Atlantic City News and have placed a nuclear weapon inside the building.\" I looked up from my building in shock. That was where Julie worked in her civilian identity!\n\n\"What...?\" I asked in shock. \"The National Guard tried to evacuate civilians away from the building before several trucks were destroyed by bombs,\" the anchorwoman said. \"The terrorist leader, known only as Tecno, has declared that he will detonate the bomb if he believes that anyone is being evacuated. Other demands have not yet been made, but...\" I switched over to ACN's channel and saw reporters and other staff being hurried into the main studio. And that was when I saw Julie sitting in the room, tied to the bomb.\n\n\"We will make this clear,\" one robotic minion said. \"Ten billion dollars deposited into the account shown on-screen, or the bomb will detonate. You have twenty-four hours to comply.\" The President won't allow anyone to pay; he's rather anal about the \"We don't negotiate with terrorists\" nonsense. Although his predecessor did comply when I lifted the White House and threatened to drop him and his family onto the ground. But I knew what buttons to press. What Tecno was doing... far too excessive to be worth it. And yet, I felt a great fire within my chest.\n\nI set my book down, pulled out my phone, and made my way to the garage while calling a number. \"Howard?\" the woman said on the other end. \"I haven't heard from you in years!

They never evolved with the luxury of self-farming fungi or a planet-wide edible plant. They were forced to scavenge. They were forced to adapt. They were forced to make do with what they had. Every race has a fundamental sense of taste, but they only evolved them in order to detect parasites hidden within their food. Humans, on the other hand, never had one consistent food source. They were forced to develop taste to identify if something was even edible, let alone tainted. Because of that, more than any other species, they developed a sort of taste-spectrum. They can identify acids and alkalis in foods, as well as identify foods high in glucose, salt, protein, carbohydrates, and so much more - and they can even tell the difference! And because their food sources were so varied and undependable, they learnt to mix different food sources into one unified meal - a \"dish\". From the day they formed their first civilisations up until today, food has remained a cornerstone of each culture. To them, ingestion was something to enjoy and relish, not just something your body compelled you to do. They ate to celebrate. They ate to socialise. They ate to feel better. Because of this, they developed something entirely unique to their kind - cooking. Cooking became an artform among them. How can you combine the various textures and flavours into the most succulent and enjoyable form possible? How can you present your food in such a way that it most stimulates the anticipation to eat? How can you optimise your food to be the most nutritious, yet still make it appealing to that specialised and refined taste? Before humans came into contact with the rest of us, a garton would eat when she walked past a fungus-tree, at which point her body would compel itself to claw a crumbly chunk out of it. She would ingest it as quickly as possible so she could get on with things. Now, a garton eats when she sits down at a mighty table, rife and beaming with anticipation. She will be served her course, and she will dig into it with no reservation or hesitation. As it passed her taste buds, she will feel a tranquil, vivifying appeasement and enjoyment surge through her entire body like a flood through a dry canyon. In those moments, she will become acquainted with a side of her that she has never met before; a passionate, artful soul that can supernaturally pick apart every bit of what makes the dish so stimulating to the senses and so delightful to the soul. She will ingest slowly, nourishing every mouthful as if they were the last things she will ever experience. She finish the meal satisfied in mind and body, and will return with glee to her daily duties. Fungus-trees, aibon-fruit, and tamarils have nothing upon even the worst of a human's work. Even better? Humans are terrible at literally everything else, so we can keep them as robotic slaves under our command to cook us these dishes forever!", "rewritten_text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\n\\boxed{\nHumans have always been a peculiar case.

They eat slowly, nourishing every mouthful, and finish the meal satisfied in both mind and body.\n\nIt's worth noting that, despite their culinary prowess, humans are remarkably inept at everything else.

I heard my wife talking to someone in low tones. I couldn't make out what she was saying so I got up and went to the kitchen to get a better earshot. The door opened and closed.

Now THAT, that is a special kinda queer. Mmmm, a three dolla bill ain't shit on that. So I just smiled the biggest smile, because this time eyes decided eyes gonna teach 'er a little lesson.

There are times you have to let them make their own mistakes. Make their won bed... and liiiiiiiiie around in it. This was one of those time.

You have a really nice and welcoming family. I appreciate that, a lot\", the boy replied in a voice a bit too high and a bit too sing song. Like he was trying out for Cats or something. Damn queer. So I went back to watching Fox News. I could smell something cooking, was it stir-fry? I wasn't sure but I know I didn't smell any meat. Who da fuck fixes dinner without meat? Fuckin' queers. And why was he in the kitchen with the women. God damn this one was fruity. Maybe my plan was backfiring. I had to right this ship.

It smells... divine.\" \"Richard! You said you would behave\" my wife admonished, again. \"Come on, you can't date my daughter if we can't rib each other. Seriously, it smells really good.

The pages of the book are infinitely compressible, so that even though the book appears as a solid mass of paper, I can easily part the pages and compress them to half their size, a quarter, a third. A fraction of the book contains an arbitrary number of pages, perhaps even as many as the book itself. At first, I felt as if my task was in fact a great blessing. The book is infinite, and contains all of human knowledge and all knowledge denied to us. It has a narrative, I am sure of that, but one so long and convoluted that I cannot even begin to comprehend it. It stretches on infinitely and touches on everything. I read the history of the world and the history of a thousand worlds separate from ours. Some of the characters were fanciful, and some I faintly recognized from a past life, rendered to me in perfect detail so that I knew them more intimately than I ever did before. I read pages of utter nonsense, letters repeated seemingly at random, and then later on detailed instructions to pull meaning from from those ciphers. At those times I paged back frantically, terrified that I would no longer be able to find the previous pages, and that some portion of the book would be obscured to me forever. I read treatises on philosophy and mathematics that left me breathless with wonder, more enlightened than any human soul still alive. I read an accounting of my own soul, and the judgement that sentenced me to this fate, and found it utterly unimpeachable. But I soon realized that where the book was infinite, I was but a speck in comparison. I could not hope to retain even a fraction of what I read. It might take a hundred years, two hundred years, but eventually even the most dazzling revelations would fade from my memory. Trying to find old pages was impossible. The pages refused to fold or tear or accept any mark. All I had to mark my place was a single bookmark, a small strip of red cloth that clung to any page I pressed it to. I could not cut it, could not tear it; it refused to stick to more than one page at a time. It was all I could do to remember where I left off before I fell asleep, my head spinning with all I had learned. I was surrounded by wonders, but could only push on ceaselessly forward. Wonder replaced itself with hopelessness and paranoia. I considered myself utterly inadequate for the task. What was the point of having access to such knowledge when I was incapable of truly comprehending it? There were moments of dread when I sat half-convinced that there was some vital piece of information that I had forgotten, that I needed to continue.

But instead I had allowed the beginning of the book to be lost, and now the ending seemed similarly out of reach. I now sought only to finish the book, in hopes that I could begin to comprehend it through its completion. Centuries passed, and certain passages began to seem familiar to me, as if I had read them before. The words were just familiar enough to give me hope, unfamiliar enough to make me doubt. When I began to suspect that my task had ended, that I had finally reached where I started and found understanding, I would come across something completely foreign and be forced to read on. For centuries still that maddened hope ate away at me, gnawed at me with every page. I obsessed over the possible explanations. If the book truly was infinite, I reasoned, it would contain every variation on every sentence. Perhaps these seeming repetitions were merely a product of having read up to this point. If one had studied the world in detail, would not everything start to seem familiar? On other days, I would conclude it was all part of my punishment. The book was shifting, the letters rearranging themselves on the page the moment I turned away, just different enough to make me doubt. The book was truly impossible to finish, warping itself simply to torment me. Or worst of all, perhaps it was merely my mind that had betrayed me.

One of us can sleep there, and you and the other can take the main bed. Then we'll swap each night.\" \"I think it could work,\" said the other. She looked at me with a grin. \"Plus, you'll have twice the action.\" My face went red as I lowered the handgun. \"That's not important,\" I mumbled. In a louder voice, I went on. \"Okay, whichever of you is the clone, you can stay.\" They both visibly relaxed as I set the gun carefully on the worktop. One looked at the other. \"Want to go out and get some extra clothes? We'll need two of everything now.\" \"Sure!\" said the second Alannah. \"Just let me put on something nicer than this. Help me choose something?\" Her twin nodded. They both smiled at me in exactly the same way as they walked out into the hall and up the stairs. I grabbed my keys and went out to sit in the car.

Stop!\" I tried to jump in front of the mate but he threw his lean body into me, nearly bowling me over, and pushed me to the side. \"My ticket paid your salary asshole!\" I shouted after him.
